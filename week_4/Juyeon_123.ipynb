      "[ The Parent  s Assistant  by Maria Edgeworth ] THE ORPHANS  Near the ruins of the castle of Rossmore  in Ireland  is a small cabin  in which there once lived a widow and her four children  As long as she was able to work  she was very industrious  and was accounted the best spinner in the parish  but she overworked herself at last  and fell ill  so that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do  and was obliged to give it up to her eldest daughter  Mary  Mary was at this time about twelve years old  One evening she was sitting at the foot of her mother  s bed spinning  and her little brothers and sisters were gathered round the fire eating their potatoes and milk for supper   Bless them  the poor young creatures  said the widow  who  as she lay on her bed  which she knew must be her deathbed  was thinking of what would become of her children after she was gone  Mary stopped her wheel  for she was afraid that the noise of it had wakened her mother  and would hinder her from going to sleep again   No need to stop the wheel  Mary  dear  for me  said her mother   I was not asleep  nor is it THAT which keeps me from sleep  But don  t overwork yourself  Mary   Oh  no fear of that  replied Mary   I  m strong and hearty   So was I once  said her mother   And so you will be again  I hope  said Mary   when the fine weather comes again   The fine weather will never come again to me  said her mother   Tis a folly  Mary  to hope for that  but what I hope is  that you  ll find some friend  some help  orphans as you  ll soon all of you be  And one thing comforts my heart  even as I AM lying here  that not a soul in the wide world I am leaving has to complain of me  Though poor I have lived honest  and I have brought you up to be the same  Mary  and I am sure the little ones will take after you  for you  ll be good to them  as good to them as you can  Here the children  who had finished eating their suppers  came round the bed  to listen to what their mother was saying  She was tired of speaking  for she was very weak  but she took their little hands  as they laid them on the bed and joining them all together  she said   Bless you  dears  bless you  love and help one another all you can  Good night  good  bye  Mary took the children away to their bed  for she saw that their mother was too ill to say more  but Mary did not herself know how ill she was  Her mother never spoke rightly afterwards  but talked in a confused way about some debts  and one in particular  which she owed to a schoolmistress for Mary  s schooling  and then she charged Mary to go and pay it  because she was not able to GO IN with it  At the end of the week she was dead and buried  and the orphans were left alone in their cabin  The two youngest girls  Peggy and Nancy  were six and seven years old  Edmund was not yet nine  but he was a stout  grown  healthy boy  and well disposed to work  He had been used to bring home turf from the bog on his back  to lead cart  horses  and often to go on errands for gentlemen  s families  who paid him a sixpence or a shilling  according to the distance which he went  so that Edmund  by some or other of these little employments  was  as he said  likely enough to earn his bread  and he told Mary to have a good heart  for that he should every year grow able to do more and more  and that he should never forget his mother  s words when she last gave him her blessing  and joined their hands all together  As for Peggy and Nancy  it was little that they could do  but they were good children  and Mary  when she considered that so much depended upon her  was resolved to exert herself to the utmost  Her first care was to pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her  for which she left money done up carefully in separate papers  When all these were paid away  there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin and a year  s schooling for herself and sisters which was due to the schoolmistress in a neighbouring village  Mary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for immediately  but in this she was disappointed  Mr  Harvey  the gentleman on whose estate she lived  was in England  and  in his absence  all was managed by a Mr  Hopkins  an agent  who was a HARD MAN  The driver came to Mary about a week after her mother  s death  and told her that the rent must be brought in the next day  and that she must leave the cabin  for a new tenant was coming into it  that she was too young to have a house to herself  and that the only thing she had to do was to get some neighbour to take her and her brother and her sisters in for charity  s sake   A hard  hearted man  The driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly used if she had not brought upon herself the ill  will of Miss Alice  the agent  s daughter  Mary  it is true  had refused to give Miss Alice a goat upon which she had set her fancy  but this was the only offence of which she had been guilty  and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the goat  s milk  which was the only thing she then liked to drink  Mary went immediately to Mr  Hopkins  the agent  to pay her rent  and she begged of him to let her stay another year in her cabin  but this he refused  It was now September th  and he said that the new tenant must come in on the th  so that she must quit it directly  Mary could not bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and sisters in FOR CHARITY  S SAKE  for the neighbours were all poor enough themselves  So she bethought herself that she might find shelter in the ruins of the old castle of Rossmore where she and her brother  in better times  had often played at hide and seek  The kitchen and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well  and a little thatch  she thought  would make them comfortable through the winter  The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in there  upon her paying him half a guinea in hand  and promising to pay the same yearly  Into these lodgings the orphans now removed  taking with them two bedsteads  a stool  chair and a table  a sort of press  which contained what little clothes they had  and a chest in which they had two hundred of meal  The chest was carried for them by some of the charitable neighbours  who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf what would make it last through the winter  These children were well thought of and pitied  because their mother was known to have been all her life honest and industrious   Sure  says one of the neighbours   we can do no less than give a helping hand to the poor orphans  that are so ready to help themselves  So one helped to thatch the room in which they were to sleep  and another took their cow to graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk  and one and all said they should be welcome to take share of their potatoes and buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall short  The half  guinea which Mr  Hopkins  the agent  required for letting Mary into the castle  was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress  to whom above a guinea was due  Mary went to her  and took her goat along with her  and offered it in part of payment of the debt  but the schoolmistress would not receive the goat  She said that she could afford to wait for her money till Mary was able to pay it  that she knew her to be an honest  industrious little girl  and she would trust her with more than a guinea  Mary thanked her  and she was glad to take the goat home again  as she was very fond of it  Being now settled in their house  they went every day regularly to work  Maud spun nine cuts a day  besides doing all that was to be done in the house  Edmund got fourpence a day by his work  and Peggy and Annie earned twopence apiece at the paper  mills near Navan  where they were employed to sort rags  and to cut them into small pieces  When they had done work one day  Annie went to the master of the paper  mill and asked him if she might have two sheets of large white paper which were lying on the press  She offered a penny for the paper  but the master would not take anything from her  but gave her the paper when he found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mother  s grave  Annie and Peggy cut out the garland  and Mary  when it was finished  went along with them and Edmund to put it up  It was just a month after their mother  s death  It happened  at the time the orphans were putting up this garland  that two young ladies  who were returning home after their evening walk  stopped at the gate of the churchyard to look at the red light which the setting sun cast upon the window of the church  As the ladies were standing at the gate  they heard a voice near them crying   O  mother  mother  are you gone for ever  They could not see anyone  so they walked softly round to the other side of the church  and there they saw Mary kneeling beside a grave  on which her brothers and sisters were hanging their white garlands  The children all stood still when they saw the two ladies passing near them  but Mary did not know anybody was passing  for her face was hid in her hands  Isabella and Caroline ( so these ladies were called ) would not disturb the poor children  but they stopped in the village to inquire about them  It was at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped  and she gave them a good account of these orphans  She particularly commended Mary  s honesty  in having immediately paid all her mother  s debts to the utmost farthing  as far as her money would go  She told the ladies how Mary had been turned out of her house  and how she had offered her goat  of which she was very fond  to discharge a debt due for her schooling  and  in short  the schoolmistress  who had known Mary for several years  spoke so well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old castle of Rossmore to see her the next day  When they went there  they found the room in which the children lived as clean and neat as such a ruined place could be made  Edmund was out working with a farmer  Mary was spinning  and her little sisters were measuring out some bogberries  of which they had gathered a basketful  for sale  Isabella  after telling Mary what an excellent character she had heard of her  inquired what it was she most wanted  and Mary said that she had just worked up all her flax  and she was most in want of more flax for her wheel  Isabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax  and Caroline bought the bogberries from the little girls  and gave them money enough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting  as Mary said that she could teach them how to knit  The supply of flax  which Isabella sent the next day  was of great service to Mary  as it kept her in employment for above a month  and when she sold the yarn which she had spun with it  she had money enough to buy some warm flannel for winter wear  Besides spinning well  she had learned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly  and Isabella and Caroline employed her to work for them  by which she earned a great deal more than she could by spinning  At her leisure hours she taught her sisters to read and write  and Edmund  with part of the money which he earned by his work out of doors  paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a little arithmetic  When the winter nights came on  he used to light his rush candles for Mary to work by  He had gathered and stripped a good provision of rushes in the month of August  and a neighbour gave him grease to dip them in  One evening  just as he had lighted his candles  a footman came in  who was sent by Isabella with some plain work to Mary  This servant was an Englishman  and he was but newly come over to Ireland  The rush candles caught his attention  for he had never seen any of them before  as he came from a part of England where they were not used  Edmund  who was ready to oblige  and proud that his candles were noticed showed the Englishman how they were made  and gave him a bundle of rushes  [ The proper species of rush  says White  in his  Natural History of Selborne   seems to be the Juncus effusus  or common soft rush  which is to be found in moist pastures  by the sides of streams  and under hedges  These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer  but may be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn  The largest and longest are the best  Decayed labourers  women  and children make it their business to procure and prepare them  As soon as they are cut  they must be flung into water  and kept there  for otherwise they will dry and shrink  and the peel will not run  When these junci are thus far prepared  they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take the dew for some nights  and afterwards be dried in the sun  Some address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or grease  but this knack is also to be attained by practice  A pound of common grease may be procured for fourpence  and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling  so that a pound of rushes  medicated and ready for use  will cost three shillings ] The servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance  and remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund  Whenever his master wanted to send a messenger anywhere  Gilbert ( for that was the servant  s name ) always employed his little friend Edmund  whom  upon further acquaintance  he liked better and better  He found that Edmund was both quick and exact in executing commissions  One day  after he had waited a great while at a gentleman  s house for an answer to a letter  he was so impatient to get home that he ran off without it  When he was questioned by Gilbert why he did not bring an answer  he did not attempt to make any excuse  he did not say   There was no answer  please your honour  or   They bid me not to wait  etc  but he told exactly the truth  and though Gilbert scolded him for being so impatient as not to wait  yet his telling the truth was more to the boy  s advantage than any excuse he could have made  After this he was always believed when he said   There was no answer  or   They bid me not wait  for Gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being scolded  The orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to their strength and abilities  and they went on in this manner for three years  With what Mary got by her spinning and plain work  and Edmund by leading of cart  horses  going on errands  etc  and with little Peggy and Anne  s earnings  the family contrived to live comfortably  Isabella and Caroline often visited them  and sometimes gave them clothes  and sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting  and these children did not EXPECT  that because the ladies did something for them  they should do everything  They did not grow idle or wasteful  When Edmund was about twelve years old  his friend Gilbert sent for him one day  and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy in the house to assist him  and that his master told him he might choose one in the neighbourhood  Several were anxious to get into such a good place  but Gilbert said that he preferred Edmund before them all  because he knew him to be an industrious  honest  good natured lad  who always told the truth  So Edmund went into service at the vicarage  and his master was the father of Isabella and Caroline  He found his new way of life very pleasant  for he was well fed  well clothed  and well treated  and he every day learned more of his business  in which at first he was rather awkward  He was mindful to do all that Mr  Gilbert required of him  and he was so obliging to all his fellow  servants that they could not help liking him  But there was one thing which was at first rather disagreeable to him  he was obliged to wear shoes and stockings  and they hurt his feet  Besides this  when he waited at dinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow  servants laughed at him  He told his sister Mary of his distress  and she made for him  after many trials  a pair of cloth shoes  with soles of platted hemp  In these he could walk without making the least noise  and as these shoes could not be worn out of doors  he was always sure to change them before he went out  and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the house  [ The author has seen a pair of shoes  such as here described  made in a few hours ] It was soon remarked by the men  servants that he had left off clumping so heavily  and it was observed by the maids that he never dirtied the stairs or passages with his shoes  When he was praised for these things  he said it was his sister Mary who should be thanked  and not he  and he showed the shoes which she had made for him  Isabella  s maid bespoke a pair immediately  and sent Mary a piece of pretty calico for the outside  The last  maker made a last for her  and over this Mary sewed the calico vamps tight  Her brother advised her to try platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles  and she found that this looked more neat than the hemp soles  and was likely to last longer  She platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch thick  and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe  When they were finished they fitted well  and the maid showed them to her mistress  Isabella and Caroline were so well pleased with Mary  s ingenuity and kindness to her brother  that they bespoke from her two dozen of these shoes  and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of  and galloon for the binding  When the shoes were completed  Isabella and Caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance  and got three shillings a pair for them  The young ladies  as soon as they had collected the money  walked to the old castle  where they found everything neat and clean as usual  They had great pleasure in giving to this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity  which she received with some surprise and more gratitude  They advised her to continue the shoemaking trade  as they found the shoes were liked  and they knew that they could have a sale for them at the Repository in Dublin  Mary  encouraged by these kind friends  went on with her little manufacture with increased activity  Peggy and Anne platted the packthread  and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her  Edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning  provided he was back again before eight o  clock  It was summer time  and he got up early  because he liked to go home to see his sisters  and he took his share in the manufactory  It was his business to hammer the soles flat  and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so much cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work  that the hour of his arrival was always an hour of joy to the family  Mary had presently employment enough upon her hands  Orders came to her for shoes from many families in the neighbourhood  and she could not get them finished fast enough  She  however  in the midst of her hurry  found time to make a very pretty pair  with neat roses  as a present for her schoolmistress  who  now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business  consented to receive the amount of her old debt  Several of the children who went to her school were delighted with the sight of Mary  s present  and went to the little manufactory at Rossmore Castle  to find out how these shoes were made  Some went from curiosity  others from idleness  but when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed whilst busy at work  they longed to take some share in what was going forward  One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles  another helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings  and all who could get employment were pleased  for the idle ones were shoved out of the way  It became a custom with the children of the village to resort to the old castle at their play hours  and it was surprising to see how much was done by ten or twelve of them  each doing but a little at a time  One morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very early  and they were busy at their work  all sitting round the meal chest  which served them for a table   My hands must be washed  said George  a little boy who came running in   I ran so fast that I might be in time  to go to work along with you all  that I tumbled down  and look how I have dirtied my hands  Most haste worst speed  My hands must be washed before I can do anything  Whilst George was washing his hands  two other little children  who had just finished their morning  s work  came to him to beg that he would blow some soap bubbles for them  and they were all three eagerly blowing bubbles  and watching them mount into the air  when suddenly they were startled by a noise as loud as thunder  They were in a sort of outer court of the castle  next to the room in which all their companions were at work  and they ran precipitately into the room  exclaiming   Did you hear that noise   I thought I heard a clap of thunder  said Mary   but why do you look so frightened  As she finished speaking  another and a louder noise  and the walls round about them shook  The children turned pale and stood motionless  but Edmund threw down his hammer  and ran out to see what was the matter  Mary followed him  and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at the farthest side of the castle had fallen down  and this was the cause of the prodigious noise  The part of the castle in which they lived seemed  as Edmund said  to be perfectly safe  but the children of the village were terrified  and thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly  they ran to their homes as fast as they could  Edmund  who was a courageous lad  and proud of showing his courage  laughed at their cowardice  but Mary  who was very prudent  persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason  who was building at his master  s  to come and give his opinion  whether their part of the castle was safe to live in or not  The mason came  and gave it as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the winter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year  Mary was sorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond  poor as it was  having lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mother  s death  which was now nearly four years  but she determined to look out for some other place to live in  and she had now money enough to pay the rent of a comfortable cabin  Without losing any time  she went to the village that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage  for she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her brother  and to the ladies who had been so kind to her  She found that there was one newly built house in this village unoccupied  it belonged to Mr  Harvey  her landlord  who was still in England  it was slated  and neatly fitted up inside  but the rent of it was six guineas a year  and this was far above what Mary could afford to pay  Three guineas a year she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage  Besides  she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr  Harvey for this house  and she knew that Mr  Hopkins  the agent  was not her friend  therefore she despaired of getting it  There was no other to be had in this village  Her brother was still more vexed than she was  that she could not find a place near him  He offered to give a guinea yearly towards the rent out of his wages  and Mr  Gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward  and inquired whether  amongst any of those who had given in proposals  there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house  and who would join with Mary in paying the rent  None could be found but a woman  who was a great scold  and a man who was famous for going to law about every trifle with his neighbours  Mary did not choose to have anything to do with these people  She did not like to speak either to Miss Isabella or Caroline about it  because she was not of an encroaching temper  and when they had done so much for her  she would have been ashamed to beg for more  She returned home to the old castle  mortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy  who she knew expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village near their brother   Bad news for you  Peggy  cried she  as soon as she got home   And bad news for you  Mary  replied her sisters  who looked very sorrowful   What  s the matter   Your poor goat is dead  replied Peggy   There she is  yonder  lying under the great corner stone  you can just see her leg  We cannot lift the stone from off her  it is so heavy  Betsy [ one of the neighbour  s girls ] says she remembers  when she came to us to work early this morning  she saw the goat rubbing itself  and butting with its horns against that old tottering chimney   Many  s the time  said Mary   that I have driven the poor thing away from that place  I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly stone down upon her at last  The goat  who had long been the favourite of Mary and her sisters  was lamented by them all  When Edmund came  he helped them to move the great stone from off the poor animal  who was crushed so as to be a terrible sight  As they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat  Anne found an odd  looking piece of money  which seemed neither like a halfpenny  nor a shilling  nor a guinea   Here are more  a great many more of them  cried Peggy  and upon searching amongst the rubbish  they discovered a small iron pot  which seemed as if it had been filled with these coins  as a vast number of them were found about the spot where it fell  On examining these coins  Edmund thought that several of them looked like gold  and the girls exclaimed with great joy  Oh  Mary  Mary  this is come to us just in right time  now you can pay for the slated house  Never was anything so lucky  But Mary  though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been able to pay for the house  observed that they could not honestly touch any of this treasure  as it belonged to the owner of the castle  Edmund agreed with her  that they ought to carry it all immediately to Mr  Hopkins  the agent  Peggy and Anne were convinced by what Mary said  and they begged to go along with her and their brother  to take the coins to Mr  Hopkins  On their way they stopped at the vicarage  to show the treasure to Mr  Gilbert  who took it to the young ladies  Isabella and Caroline  and told them how it had been found  It is not only by their superior riches  but it is yet more by their superior knowledge  that persons in the higher rank of life may assist those in a lower condition  Isabella  who had some knowledge of chemistry  discovered  by touching the coins with nitric acid  that several of them were of gold  and consequently of great value  Caroline also found out that many of the coins were very valuable as curiosities  She recollected her father  s having shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each king  s reign  in  Rapin  s History of England  and upon comparing these impressions with the coins found by the orphans  she perceived that many of them were of the reign of Henry the Seventh  which  from their scarcity  were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors  Isabella and Caroline  knowing something of the character of Mr  Hopkins  the agent  had the precaution to count the coins  and to mark each of them with a cross  so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked eye  though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass  They also begged that their father  who was well acquainted with Mr  Harvey  the gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged  to write to him  and tell him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had found  The value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty guineas  A few days after the fall of the chimney at Rossmore Castle  as Mary and her sisters were sitting at their work  there came hobbling in an old woman  leaning on a crab stick  that seemed to have been newly cut  She had a broken tobacco  pipe in her mouth  her head was wrapped up in two large red and blue handkerchiefs  with their crooked corners hanging far down over the back of her neck  no shoes on her broad feet  nor stockings on her many  coloured legs  Her petticoat was jagged at the bottom  and the skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders  to serve instead of a cloak  which she had sold for whisky  This old woman was well known amongst the country people by the name of Goody Grope  because she had  for many years  been in the habit of groping in old castles  and in moats  and at the bottom of a round tower  in the neighbourhood  in search of treasure  In her youth she had heard someone talking  in a whisper  of an old prophecy  found in a bog  which said that before many  St  Patrick  s days should come about  There would be found A treasure under ground  By one within twenty miles round  This prophecy made a deep impression upon her  She also dreamed of it three times  and as the dream  she thought  was a sure token that the prophecy was to come true  she  from that time forwards  gave up her spinning  wheel and her knitting  and could think of nothing but hunting for the treasure  that was to be found by one  within twenty miles round  [ Goody is not a word used in Ireland  Collyogh is the Irish appellation of an old woman  but as Collyogh might sound strangely to English ears  we have translated it by the word Goody   What are in Ireland called moats  are  in England  called Danish mounds  or barrows   Near Kells  in Ireland  there is a round tower  which was in imminent danger of being pulled down by an old woman  s rooting at its foundation  in hopes of finding treasure ] Year after year St  Patrick  s day came about  without her ever finding a farthing by all her groping  and as she was always idle  she grew poorer and poorer  Besides  to comfort herself for her disappointments  and to give her spirits for fresh searches  she took to drinking  She sold all she had by degrees  but still she fancied that the lucky day would come sooner or later  THAT WOULD PAY FOR ALL  Goody Grope  however  reached her sixtieth year  without ever seeing this lucky day  and now  in her old age  she was a beggar  without a house to shelter her  a bed to lie on  or food to put into her mouth  but what she begged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to industry and less to LUCK   Ah  Mary  honey  give me a potato and a sup of something  for the love o  mercy  for not a bit have I had all day  except half a glass of whisky and a halfpenny worth of tobacco  Mary immediately set before her some milk  and picked a good potato out of the bowl for her  She was sorry to see such an old woman in such a wretched condition  Goody Grope said she would rather have spirits of some kind or other than milk  but Mary had no spirits to give her  so she sat herself down close to the fire  and after she had sighed and groaned and smoked for some time  she said to Mary   Well  and what have you done with the treasure you had the luck to find  Mary told her that she had carried it to Mr  Hopkins  the agent   That  s not what I would have done in your place  replied the old woman   When good luck came to you  what a shame to turn your back upon it  But it is idle talking of what  s done  that  s past  but I  ll try my luck in this here castle before next St  Patrick  s day comes about  I was told it was more than twenty miles from our bog or I would have been here long ago  but better late than never  Mary was much alarmed  and not without reason  at this speech  for she knew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the foundation of the old castle of Rossmore  she would soon bring it all down  It was in vain to talk to Goody Grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins  or of the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins  She set her elbow upon her knees  and stopping her ears with her hands bid Mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders  for that  let them say what they would  she would fall to work the next morning   BARRING you  ll make it worth my while to let it alone   And what will make it worth your while to let it alone  said Mary  for she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her habitation  or comply with the conditions of this provoking old woman  Half a crown  Goody Grope said  was the least she could be content to take  Mary paid the half  crown  and was in hopes that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor  but she was mistaken  for scarcely was the week at an end before the old woman appeared before her again  and repeated her threats of falling to work the next morning  unless she had something given to her to buy tobacco  The next day and the next  and the next  Goody Grope came on the same errand  and poor Mary  who could ill  afford to supply her constantly with halfpence  at last exclaimed   I am sure the finding of this treasure has not been any good luck to us  but quite the contrary  and I wish we never had found it  Mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this unfortunate pot of gold coins  Mr  Hopkins  the agent  imagined that no one knew of the discovery of this treasure but himself and these poor children  so  not being as honest as they were  he resolved to keep it for his own use  He was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a letter from his employer  Mr  Harvey  demanding from him the coins which had been discovered at Rossmore Castle  Hopkins had sold the gold coins  and some of the others  and he flattered himself that the children  and the young ladies  to whom he now found they had been shown  could not tell whether what they had seen were gold or not  and he was not in the least apprehensive that those of Henry the Seventh  s reign should be reclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention  So he sent over the silver coins and others of little value  and apologized for his not having mentioned them before  by saying that he considered them as mere rubbish  Mr  Harvey  in reply  observed that he could not consider as rubbish the gold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered  and he inquired why these gold coins  and those of the reign of Henry the Seventh  were not now sent to him  Mr  Hopkins denied that he had ever received any such  but he was thunderstruck when Mr  Harvey  in reply to this falsehood  sent him a list of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him  and exact drawings of those that were missing  He informed him that this list and these drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question  Mr  Hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly persisting in falsehood  He replied  that it was very likely such coins had been found at Rossmore Castle  and that the ladies alluded to had probably seen them  but he positively declared that they never came to his hands  that he had restored all that were deposited with him  and that  as to the others  he supposed they must have been taken out of the pot by the children  or by Edmund or Mary on their way from the ladies  house to his  The orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard  from Isabella and Caroline  the charge that was made against them  They looked at one another in silence for some moments  Then Peggy exclaimed  Sure  Mr  Hopkins has forgotten himself strangely  Does not he remember Edmund  s counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall  and we all standing by  I remember it as well as if it was this instant   And so do I  cried Anne   And don  t you recollect  Mary  your picking out the gold ones  and telling Mr  Hopkins that they were gold  and he said you knew nothing of the matter  and I was going to tell him that Miss Isabella had tried them  and knew that they were gold  but just then there came in some tenants to pay their rent  and he pushed us out  and twitched from my hand the piece of gold which I had taken up to show him the bright spot which Miss Isabella had cleaned by the stuff that she had poured on it  I believe he was afraid I should steal it  he twitched it from my hand in such a hurry  Do  Edmund  do  Mary  let us go to him  and put him in mind of all this   I  ll go to him no more  said Edmund  sturdily   He is a bad man  I  ll never go to him again  Mary  don  t be cast down  we have no need to be cast down  we are honest   True  said Mary   but is not it a hard case that we  who have lived  as my mother did all her life before us  in peace and honesty with all the world  should now have our good name taken from us  when  Mary  s voice faltered and stopped   It can  t be taken from us  cried Edmund   poor orphans though we are  and he a rich gentleman  as he calls himself  Let him say and do what he will  he can  t hurt our good name  Edmund was mistaken  alas  and Mary had but too much reason for her fears  The affair was a great deal talked of  and the agent spared no pains to have the story told his own way  The orphans  conscious of their own innocence  took no pains about the matter  and the consequence was  that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty  but many  who knew nothing of them  concluded that the agent must be in the right and the children in the wrong  The buzz of scandal went on for some time without reaching their ears  because they lived very retiredly  But one day  when Mary went to sell some stockings of Peggy  s knitting at the neighbouring fair  the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name on the back of a note  and exclaimed  on seeing it  Ho  ho  mistress  I  d not have had any dealings with you  had I known your name sooner  Where  s the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle  It was in vain that Mary related the fact  She saw that she gained no belief  as her character was not known to this man  or to any of those who were present  She left the fair as soon as she could  and though she struggled against it  she felt very melancholy  Still she exerted herself every day at her little manufacture  and she endeavoured to console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up her character  and who continued steadily to protect her and her sisters  Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity of the orphans  but to prove it was in this instance out of their power  Mr  Hopkins  the agent  and his friends  constantly repeated that the gold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his  and these ladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those that were  with great reason  suspected to be thieves  The orphans were in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on  and their benefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin  The old castle  it was true  was likely to last through the winter  as the mason said  but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was  a little while ago  the uppermost thing in Mary  s thoughts  now it was not so  One night as Mary was going to bed  she heard someone knocking hard at the door   Mary  are you up  let us in  cried a voice  which she knew to be the voice of Betsy Green  the postmaster  s daughter  who lived in the village near them  She let Betsy in  and asked what she could want at such a time of night   Give me sixpence  and I  ll tell you  said Betsy   but waken Anne and Peggy  Here  s a letter just come by post for you  and I stepped over to you with it  because I guessed you  d be glad to have it  seeing it is your brother  s handwriting  Peggy and Anne were soon roused  when they heard that there was a letter from Edmund  It was by one of his rush candles that Mary read it  and the letter was as follows   DEAR MARY  NANCY  AND LITTLE PEG   Joy  joy  I always said the truth would come out at last  and that he could not take our good name from us  But I will not tell you how it all came about till we meet  which will be next week  as we are ( I mean  master and mistress  and the young ladies  bless them  and Mr  Gilbert and I ) coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas  and a happy Christmas  tis likely to be for honest folks  As for they that are not honest  it is not for them to expect to be happy  at Christmas  or any other time  You shall know all when we meet  So  till then  fare ye well  dear Mary  Nancy  and little Peg   Your joyful and affectionate brother  EDMUND  To comprehend why Edmund is joyful  our readers must be informed of certain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin  One morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent library of a nobleman  who took generous and polite pleasure in thus sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any pretensions to science or literature  Knowing that the gentleman who was now come to see his library was skilled in antiquities  the nobleman opened a drawer of medals  to ask his opinion concerning the age of some coins  which he had lately purchased at a high price  They were the very same which the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle  Isabella and Caroline knew them again instantly  and as the cross which Isabella had made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass  there could be no possibility of doubt  The nobleman  who was much interested both by the story of these orphans  and the manner in which it was told to him  sent immediately for the person from whom he had purchased the coins  He was a Jew broker  At first he refused to tell them from whom he got them  because he had bought them  he said  under a promise of secrecy  Being further pressed  he acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he should not sell them to anyone in Ireland  but that he had been tempted by the high price the present noble possessor had offered  At last  when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen  and that he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods  if he did not confess the whole truth  he declared that he had purchased them from a gentleman  whom he had never seen before or since  but he added  that he could swear to his person  if he saw him again  Now  Mr  Hopkins  the agent  was at this time in Dublin  and Caroline  s father posted the Jew  the next day  in the back  parlour of a banker  s house  with whom Mr  Hopkins had  on this day  appointed to settle some accounts  Mr  Hopkins came  the Jew knew him  swore that he was the man who had sold the coins to him  and thus the guilt of the agent and the innocence of the orphans were completely proved  A full account of all that happened was sent to England to Mr  Harvey  their landlord  and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him  containing a dismissal of the dishonest agent  and a reward for the honest and industrious orphans  Mr  Harvey desired that Mary and her sisters might have the slated house  rent free  from this time forward  under the care of ladies Isabella and Caroline  as long as Mary or her sisters should carry on in it any useful business  This was the joyful news which Edmund had to tell his sisters  All the neighbours shared in their joy  and the day of their removal from the ruins of Rossmore Castle to their new house was the happiest of the Christmas holidays  They were not envied for their prosperity  because everybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct  everybody except Goody Grope  She exclaimed  as she wrung her hands with violent expressions of sorrow  Bad luck to me  bad luck to me  Why didn  t I go sooner to that there castle  It is all luck  all luck in this world  but I never had no luck  Think of the luck of these childer  that have found a pot of gold  and such great  grand friends  and a slated house  and all  and here am I  with scarce a rag to cover me  and not a potato to put into my mouth  I  that have been looking under ground all my days for treasure  not to have a halfpenny at the last  to buy me tobacco   That is the very reason that you have not a halfpenny  said Betsy   Here Mary has been working hard  and so have her two little sisters and her brother  for these five years past  and they have made money for themselves by their own industry  and friends too  not by luck  but by   Phoo  phoo  interrupted Goody Grope   don  t be prating  don  t I know as well as you do  that they found a pot of gold  BY GOOD LUCK  and is not that the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now   No  replied the postmaster  s daughter   this house is given to them AS A REWARD  that was the word in the letter  for I saw it  Edmund showed it to me  and will show it to anyone that wants to see  This house was given to them  AS A REWARD FOR THEIR HONESTY  LAZY LAWRENCE  In the pleasant valley of Ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name of Preston  She had a small neat cottage  and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden  It was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for support  it consisted of strawberry beds  and one small border for flowers  The pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays  and sent either to Clifton or Bristol to be sold  As to her strawberries  she did not send them to market  because it was the custom for numbers of people to come from Clifton  in the summer time  to eat strawberries and cream at the gardens in Ashton  Now  the widow Preston was so obliging  active and good  humoured  that everyone who came to see her was pleased  She lived happily in this manner for several years  but  alas  one autumn she fell sick  and  during her illness  everything went wrong  her garden was neglected  her cow died  and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for medicines  The winter passed away  while she was so weak that she could earn but little by her work  and when the summer came  her rent was called for  and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual  She begged a few months  delay  and they were granted to her  but at the end of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot  Now Lightfoot  though perhaps he had seen his best days  was a very great favourite  In his youth he had always carried the dame to the market behind her husband  and it was now her little son Jem  s turn to ride him  It was Jem  s business to feed Lightfoot  and to take care of him  a charge which he never neglected  for  besides being a very good natured  he was a very industrious boy   It will go near to break my Jem  s heart  said Dame Preston to herself  as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers  and considering how she had best open the matter to her son  who stood opposite to her  eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper   Jem  said the old woman   what  ar  t hungry   That I am  brave and hungry   Ay  no wonder  you  ve been brave hard at work  Eh   Brave hard  I wish it was not so dark  mother  that you might just step out and see the great bed I  ve dug  I know you  d say it was no bad day  s work  and oh  mother  I  ve good news  Farmer Truck will give us the giant strawberries  and I  m to go for  em tomorrow morning  and I  ll be back afore breakfast   God bless the boy  how he talks  Four mile there  and four mile back again  afore breakfast   Ay  upon Lightfoot  you know  mother  very easily  mayn  t I   Ay  child   Why do you sigh  mother   Finish thy supper  child   I  ve done  cried Jem  swallowing the last mouthful hastily  as if he thought he had been too long at supper  and now for the great needle  I must see and mend Lightfoot  s bridle afore I go to bed  To work he set  by the light of the fire  and the dame having once more stirred it  began again with  Jem  dear  does he go lame at all now   What  Lightfoot  Oh  la  no  not he  never was so well of his lameness in all his life  He  s grown quite young again  I think  and then he  s so fat he can hardly wag   God bless him  that  s right  We must see  Jem  and keep him fat   For what  mother   For Monday fortnight at the fair  He  s to be  sold   Lightfoot  cried Jem  and let the bridle fall from his hand   and WILL mother sell Lightfoot   WILL  no  but I MUST  Jem   MUST  who says you MUST  why MUST you  mother   I must  I say  child  Why  must not I pay my debts honestly  and must not I pay my rent  and was not it called for long and long ago  and have not I had time  and did not I promise to pay it for certain Monday fortnight  and am not I two guineas short  and where am I to get two guineas  So what signifies talking  child  said the widow  leaning her head upon her arm   Lightfoot MUST go  Jem was silent for a few minutes  Two guineas  that  s a great  great deal  If I worked  and worked  and worked ever so hard  I could no ways earn two guineas AFORE Monday fortnight  could I  mother   Lord help thee  no  not an  work thyself to death   But I could earn something  though  I say  cried Jem  proudly   and I WILL earn SOMETHING  if it be ever so little  it will be SOMETHING  and I shall do my very best  so I will   That I  m sure of  my child  said his mother  drawing him towards her and kissing him   you were always a good  industrious lad  THAT I will say afore your face or behind your back  but it won  t do now  Lightfoot MUST go  Jem turned away struggling to hide his tears  and went to bed without saying a word more  But he knew that crying would do no good  so he presently wiped his eyes  and lay awake  considering what he could possibly do to save the horse   If I get ever so little  he still said to himself   it will be SOMETHING  and who knows but landlord might then wait a bit longer  and we might make it all up in time  for a penny a day might come to two guineas in time  But how to get the first penny was the question  Then he recollected that one day  when he had been sent to Clifton to sell some flowers  he had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various sparkling stones  which people stopped to look at as they passed  and he remembered that some people bought the stones  one paid twopence  another threepence  and another sixpence for them  and Jem heard her say that she got them amongst the neighbouring rocks  so he thought that if he tried he might find some too  and sell them as she had done  Early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme  jumped up  dressed himself  and  having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his stable  set off to Clifton in search of the old woman  to inquire where she found her sparkling stones  But it was too early in the morning  the old woman was not at her seat  so he turned back again  disappointed  He did not waste his time waiting for her  but saddled and bridled Lightfoot  and went to Farmer Truck  s for the giant strawberries  A great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground  and  as soon as that was finished  he set out again in quest of the old woman  whom  to his great joy  he spied sitting at her corner of the street with her board before her  But this old woman was deaf and cross  and when at last Jem made her hear his questions  he could get no answer from her  but that she found the fossils where he would never find any more   But can  t I look where you looked   Look away  nobody hinders you  replied the old woman  and these were the only words she would say  Jem was not  however  a boy to be easily discouraged  he went to the rocks  and walked slowly along  looking at all the stones as he passed  Presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening some large rocks  and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly  Jem ran up  and asked if he could help him   Yes  said the man   you can  I  ve just dropped  amongst this heap of rubbish  a fine piece of crystal that I got to  day   What kind of a looking thing is it  said Jem   White  and like glass  said the man  and went on working whilst Jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while   Come  said the man   it  s gone for ever  don  t trouble yourself any more  my boy   It  s no trouble  I  ll look a little longer  we  ll not give it up so soon  said Jem  and after he had looked a little longer  he found the piece of crystal   Thank  e  said the man   you are a fine little industrious fellow  Jem  encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this  ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman   One good turn deserves another  said the man   we are going to dinner just now  and shall leave off work  wait for me here  and I  ll make it worth your while  Jem waited  and  as he was very attentively observing how the workmen went on with their work  he heard somebody near him give a great yawn  and  turning round  he saw stretched upon the grass  beside the river  a boy about his own age  who  in the village of Ashton  as he knew  went by the name of Lazy Lawrence  a name which he most justly deserved  for he never did anything from morning to night  He neither worked nor played  but sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning  His father was an ale  house keeper  and being generally drunk  could take no care of his son  so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse  However  some of the neighbours said that he was a good natured  poor fellow enough  and would never do anyone harm but himself  whilst others  who were wiser  often shook their heads  and told him that idleness was the root of all evil   What  Lawrence  cried Jem to him  when he saw him lying upon the grass   what  are you asleep   Not quite   Are you awake   Not quite   What are you doing there   Nothing   What are you thinking of   Nothing   What makes you lie there   I don  t know  because I can  t find anybody to play with me to  day  Will you come and play   No  I can  t  I  m busy   Busy  cried Lawrence  stretching himself   you are always busy  I would not be you for the world  to have so much to do always   And I  said Jem  laughing   would not be you for the world  to have nothing to do  They then parted  for the workman just then called Jem to follow him  He took him home to his own house  and showed him a parcel of fossils  which he had gathered  he said  on purpose to sell  but had never had time enough to sell them  Now  however  he set about the task  and having picked out those which he judged to be the best  he put them in a small basket  and gave them to Jem to sell  upon condition that he should bring him half of what he got  Jem  pleased to be employed  was ready to agree to what the man proposed  provided his mother had no objection  When he went home to dinner  he told his mother his scheme  and she smiled  and said he might do as he pleased  for she was not afraid of his being from home   You are not an idle boy  said she   so there is little danger of your getting into any mischief  Accordingly Jem that evening took his stand  with his little basket  upon the bank of the river  just at the place where people land from a ferry  boat  and the walk turns to the wells  and numbers of people perpetually pass to drink the waters  He chose his place well  and waited nearly all the evening  offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger  but not one person bought any   Hallo  cried some sailors  who had just rowed a boat to land   bear a hand here  will you  my little fellow  and carry these parcels for us into yonder house  Jem ran down immediately for the parcels  and did what he was asked to do so quickly  and with so much good  will  that the master of the boat took notice of him  and  when he was going away  stopped to ask him what he had got in his little basket  and when he saw that they were fossils  he immediately told Jem to follow him  for that he was going to carry some shells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was making a grotto   She will very likely buy your stones into the bargain  Come along  my lad  we can but try  The lady lived but a very little way off  so that they were soon at her house  She was alone in her parlour  and was sorting a bundle of feathers of different colours  they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat  and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells  he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard  and scattered all the feathers  The lady looked very sorry  which Jem observing  he took the opportunity  whilst she was busy looking over the sailor  s bag of shells  to gather together all the feathers  and sort them according to their different colours  as he had seen them sorted when he first came into the room   Where is the little boy you brought with you  I thought I saw him here just now   And here I am  ma  am  cried Jem  creeping from under the table  with some few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet   I thought  added he  pointing to the others   I had better be doing something than standing idle  ma  am  She smiled  and  pleased with his activity and simplicity  began to ask him several questions  such as who he was  where he lived  what employment he had  and how much a day he earned by gathering fossils   This is the first day I ever tried  said Jem   I never sold any yet  and if you don  t buy  em now  ma  am  I  m afraid nobody else will  for I  ve asked everybody else   Come  then  said the lady  laughing   if that is the case  I think I had better buy them all  So  emptying all the fossils out of his basket  she put half a crown into it  Jem  s eyes sparkled with joy   Oh  thank you  ma  am  said he   I will be sure and bring you as many more  to  morrow   Yes  but I don  t promise you  said she   to give you half a crown  to  morrow   But  perhaps  though you don  t promise it  you will   No  said the lady   do not deceive yourself  I assure you that I will not  THAT  instead of encouraging you to be industrious  would teach you to be idle  Jem did not quite understand what she meant by this  but answered   I  m sure I don  t wish to be idle  what I want is to earn something every day  if I know how  I  m sure I don  t wish to be idle  If you knew all  you  d know I did not   How do you mean  IF I KNEW ALL   Why  I mean  if you knew about Lightfoot   Who  s Lightfoot   Why  mammy  s horse  added Jem  looking out of the window   I must make haste home  and feed him afore it gets dark  he  ll wonder what  s gone with me   Let him wonder a few minutes longer  said the lady   and tell me the rest of your story   I  ve no story  ma  am  to tell  but as how mammy says he must go to the fair Monday fortnight  to be sold  if she can  t get the two guineas for her rent  and I should be main sorry to part with him  for I love him  and he loves me  so I  ll work for him  I will  all I can  To be sure  as mammy says  I have no chance  such a little fellow as I am  of earning two guineas afore Monday fortnight   But are you willing earnestly to work  said the lady   you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones  and working steadily every day  and all day long   But  said Jem   I would work every day  and all day long   Then  said the lady   I will give you work  Come here  to  morrow morning  and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies  and I will pay you sixpence a day  Remember  you must be at the gates by six o  clock  Jem bowed  thanked her  and went away  It was late in the evening  and Jem was impatient to get home to feed Lightfoot  yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had trusted him to sell the fossils  that he would bring him half of what he got for them  so he thought that he had better go to him directly  and away he went  running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile  till he came to the man  s house  He was just come home from work  and was surprised when Jem showed him the half  crown  saying   Look what I got for the stones  you are to have half  you know   No  said the man  when he had heard his story   I shall not take half of that  it was given to you  I expected but a shilling at the most  and the half of that is but sixpence  and that I  ll take  Wife  give the lad two shillings  and take this half  crown  So the wife opened an old glove  and took out two shillings  and the man  as she opened the glove  put in his fingers  and took out a little silver penny   There  he shall have that into the bargain for his honesty  honesty is the best policy  there  s a lucky penny for you  that I  ve kept ever since I can remember   Don  t you ever go to part with it  do ye hear  cried the woman   Let him do what he will with it  wife  said the man   But  argued the wife   another penny would do just as well to buy gingerbread  and that  s what it will go for   No  that it shall not  I promise you  said Jem  and so he ran away home  fed Lightfoot  stroked him  went to bed  jumped up at five o  clock in the morning  and went singing to work as gay as a lark  Four days he worked  every day and all day long  and every evening the lady  when she came out to walk in her gardens  looked at his work  At last she said to her gardener   This little boy works very hard   Never had so good a little boy about the grounds  said the gardener   he  s always at his work  let me come by when I will  and he has got twice as much done as another would do  yes  twice as much  ma  am  for look here  he began at this  ere rose  bush  and now he  s got to where you stand  ma  am  and here is the day  s work that t  other boy  and he  s three years older too  did to  day  I say  measure Jem  s fairly  and it  s twice as much  I  m sure   Well  said the lady to her gardener   show me how much is a fair day  s work for a boy of his age   Come at six o  clock and go at six  why  about this much  ma  am  said the gardener  marking off a piece of the border with his spade   Then  little boy  said the lady   so much shall be your task every day  The gardener will mark it off for you  and when you  ve done  the rest of the day you may do what you please  Jem was extremely glad of this  and the next day he had finished his task by four o  clock  so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself  He was as fond of play as any little boy could be  and when he was at it he played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable  so as soon as he had finished his task  fed Lightfoot  and put by the sixpence he had earned that day  he ran to the playground in the village  where he found a party of boys playing  and amongst them Lazy Lawrence  who indeed was not playing  but lounging upon a gate  with his thumb in his mouth  The rest were playing at cricket  Jem joined them  and was the merriest and most active amongst them  till  at last  when quite out of breath with running  he was obliged to give up to rest himself  and sat down upon the stile  close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging   And why don  t you play  Lawrence  said he   I  m tired  said Lawrence   Tired of what   I don  t know well what tires me  grandmother says I  m ill  and I must take something  I don  t know what ails me   Oh  pugh  take a good race  one  two  three  and away  and you  ll find yourself as well as ever  Come  run  one  two  three  and away   Ah  no  I can  t run  indeed  said he  hanging back heavily   you know I can play all day long if I like it  so I don  t mind play as you do  who have only one hour for it   So much the worse for you  Come  now  I  m quite fresh again  will you have one game at ball  do   No  I tell you I can  t  I  m as tired as if I had been working all day long as hard as a horse   Ten times more  said Jem   for I have been working all day long  as hard as a horse  and yet you see I  m not a bit tired  only a little out of breath just now   That  s very odd  said Lawrence  and yawned  for want of some better answer  then taking out a handful of halfpence  See what I got from father today  because I asked him just at the right time  when he had drunk a glass or two  then I can get anything I want out of him  see  a penny  twopence  threepence  fourpence  there  s eightpence in all  would not you be happy if you had EIGHTPENCE   Why  I don  t know  said Jem  laughing   for you don  t seem happy  and you HAVE EIGHTPENCE   That does not signify  though  I  m sure you only say that because you envy me  You don  t know what it is to have eightpence  You never had more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life  Jem smiled   Oh  as to that  said he   you are mistaken  for I have at this very time more than twopence  threepence  or eightpence either  I have  let me  see  stones  two shillings  then five days  work  that  s five sixpences  that  s two shillings and sixpence  in all  makes four shillings and sixpence  and my silver penny  is four and sevenpence  four and sevenpence   You have not  said Lawrence  roused so as absolutely to stand upright   four and sevenpence  have you  Show it me  and then I  ll believe you   Follow me  then  cried Jem   and I  ll soon make you believe me  come   Is it far  said Lawrence  following half  running  half  hobbling  till he came to the stable  where Jem showed him his treasure   And how did you come by it  honestly   Honestly  to be sure I did  I earned it all   Lord bless me  earned it  well  I  ve a great mind to work  but then it  s such hot weather  besides  grandmother says I  m not strong enough yet for hard work  and besides  I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want it  so I need not work  But four and sevenpence  let  s see  what will you do with it all   That  s a secret  said Jem  looking great   I can guess  I know what I  d do with it if it was mine  First  I  d buy pocketfuls of gingerbread  then I  d buy ever so many apples and nuts  Don  t you love nuts  I  d buy nuts enough to last me from this time to Christmas  and I  d make little Newton crack  em for me  for that  s the worst of nuts  there  s the trouble of cracking  em   Well  you never deserve to have a nut   But you  ll give me some of yours  said Lawrence  in a fawning tone  for he thought it easier to coax than to work  you  ll give me some of your good things  won  t you   I shall not have any of those good things  said Jem   Then  what will you do with all your money   Oh  I know very well what to do with it  but  as I told you  that  s a secret  and I sha  n  t tell it anybody  Come now  let  s go back and play   their game  s up  I daresay  Lawrence went back with him  full of curiosity  and out of humour with himself and his eightpence   If I had four and sevenpence  said he to himself   I certainly should be happy  The next day  as usual  Jem jumped up before six o  clock and went to his work  whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do with himself  In the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and gingerbread  and as long as these lasted  he found himself well received by his companions  but  at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny  and when it was gone  unfortunately some nuts tempted him very much  but he had no money to pay for them  so he ran home to coax his father  as he called it  When he got home he heard his father talking very loud  and at first he thought he was drunk  but when he opened the kitchen door  he saw that he was not drunk  but angry   You lazy dog  cried he  turning suddenly upon Lawrence  and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes   you lazy dog  See what you  ve done for me  look  look  look  I say  Lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses  and with fear  amazement and remorse  beheld at least a dozen bottles burst  and the fine Worcestershire cider streaming over the floor   Now  did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the cellar  and did not I charge you to wire the corks  answer me  you lazy rascal  did not I   Yes  said Lawrence  scratching his head   And why was not it done  I ask you  cried his father  with renewed anger  as another bottle burst at the moment   What do you stand there for  you lazy brat  why don  t you move  I say  No  no  catching hold of him   I believe you can  t move  but I  ll make you  And he shook him till Lawrence was so giddy he could not stand   What had you to think of  What had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider  my Worcestershire cider  to the cellar when I bid you  But go  you  ll never be good for anything  you are such a lazy rascal  get out of my sight  So saying  he pushed him out of the house door  and Lawrence sneaked off  seeing that this was no time to make his petition for halfpence  The next day he saw the nuts again  and wishing for them more than ever  he went home  in hopes that his father  as he said to himself  would be in a better humour  But the cider was still fresh in his recollection  and the moment Lawrence began to whisper the word  halfpenny  in his ear  his father swore  with a loud oath   I will not give you a halfpenny  no  not a farthing  for a month to come  If you want money  go work for it  I  ve had enough of your laziness  go work  At these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears  and  going to the side of a ditch  sat down and cried for an hour  and when he had cried till he could cry no more  he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets  to see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left  and  to his great joy  in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found  With this he proceeded to the fruit woman  s stall  She was busy weighing out some plums  so he was obliged to wait  and whilst he was waiting he heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud  The fruit woman  s stall was at the gate of an inn yard  and peeping through the gate in this yard  Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy  about his own size  playing at pitch farthing  He stood by watching them for a few minutes   I began but with one halfpenny  cried the stable boy  with an oath   and now I  ve got twopence  added he  jingling the halfpence in his waistcoat pocket  Lawrence was moved at the sound  and said to himself   If _I_ begin with one halfpenny I may end  like him  with having twopence  and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to work  So he stepped forward  presenting his halfpenny  offering to toss up with the stable boy  who  after looking him full in the face  accepted the proposal  and threw his halfpenny into the air   Head or tail  cried he   Head  replied Lawrence  and it came up head  He seized the penny  surprised at his own success  and would have gone instantly to have laid it out in nuts  but the stable boy stopped him  and tempted him to throw again  This time Lawrence lost  he threw again and won  and so he went on  sometimes losing  but most frequently winning  till half the morning was lost  At last  however  finding himself the master of three halfpence  said he would play no more  The stable boy  grumbling  swore he would have his revenge another time  and Lawrence went and bought his nuts   It is a good thing  said he to himself   to play at pitch farthing  the next time I want a halfpenny I  ll not ask my father for it  nor go to work neither  Satisfied with this resolution  he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure  upon the horse block in the inn yard  Here  whilst he ate  he overheard the conversation of the stable boys and postilions  At first their shocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him  for Lawrence  though lazy  had not yet learned to be a wicked boy  But  by degrees  he was accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling  and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles  As this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion  he soon grew so fond of it  that every day he returned to the stable yard  and the horse block became his constant seat  Here he found some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing  and here  hour after hour  with his elbows on his knees  and his head on his hands  he sat  the spectator of wickedness  Gaming  cheating and lying soon became familiar to him  and  to complete his ruin  he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy ( a very bad boy ) with whom he had first begun to game  The consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see  But it is now time to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while  One day  after Jem had finished his task  the gardener asked him to stay a little while  to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall  Jem  always active and obliging  readily stayed from play  and was carrying in a heavy flower pot  when his mistress crossed the hall   What a terrible litter  said she   you are making here  why don  t you wipe your shoes upon the mat  Jem turned to look for the mat  but he saw none   Oh  said the lady recollecting herself   I can  t blame you  for there is no mat   No  ma  am  said the gardener   nor I don  t know when  if ever  the man will bring home those mats you bespoke  ma  am   I am very sorry to hear that  said the lady   I wish we could find somebody who would do them  if he can  t  I should not care what sort of mats they were  so that one could wipe one  s feet on them  Jem  as he was sweeping away the litter  when he heard these last words  said to himself   Perhaps I could make a mat  And all the way home  as he trudged along whistling  he was thinking over a scheme for making mats  which  however bold it may appear  he did not despair of executing  with patience and industry  Many were the difficulties which his  prophetic eye  foresaw  but he felt within himself that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises  and makes them  trample on impossibilities  In the first place  he recollected that he had seen Lazy Lawrence  whilst he lounged upon the gate  twist a bit of heath into different shapes  and he thought  that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together  it would make a very pretty green soft mat  which would do very well for one to wipe one  s shoes on  About a mile from his mother  s house  on the common which Jem rode over when he went to Farmer Truck  s for the giant strawberries  he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath  and  as it was now only six o  clock in the evening  he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot  stroke him  go to the common  return  and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed  Lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common  and there Jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want  But what toil  what time  what pains did it cost him  before he could make anything like a mat  Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath  and give up his project  from impatience of repeated disappointments  But still he persevered  Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and time  Two hours he worked before he went to bed  All his play hours the next day he spent at his mat  which  in all  made five hours of fruitless attempts  The sixth  however  repaid him for the labours of the other five  He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath substantially together  and at length completely finished a mat  which far surpassed his most sanguine expectations  He was extremely happy  sang  danced round it  whistled  looked at it again and again  and could hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed  He laid it by his bedside  that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning  And now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress  She looked fully as much surprised as he expected  when she saw it  and when she heard who made it  After having duly admired it  she asked how much he expected for his mat   Expect  Nothing  ma  am  said Jem   I meant to give it you  if you  d have it  I did not mean to sell it  I made it in my play hours  I was very happy in making it  and I  m very glad  too  that you like it  and if you please to keep it  ma  am  that  s all   But that  s not all  said the lady   Spend your time no more in weeding in my garden  you can employ yourself much better  you shall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry  Make as many more such mats as you can  and I will take care and dispose of them for you   Thank  e  ma  am  said Jem  making his best bow  for he thought by the lady  s looks that she meant to do him a favour  though he repeated to himself   Dispose of them  what does that mean  The next day he went to work to make more mats  and he soon learned to make them so well and quickly  that he was surprised at his own success  In every one he made he found less difficulty  so that  instead of making two  he could soon make four in a day  In a fortnight he made eighteen  It was Saturday night when he finished  and he carried  at three journeys  his eighteen mats to his mistress  house  piled them all up in the hall  and stood with his hat off  with a look of proud humility  beside the pile  waiting for his mistress  appearance  Presently a folding  door  at one end of the hall  opened  and he saw his mistress  with a great many gentlemen and ladies  rising from several tables   Oh  there is my little boy and his mats  cried the lady  and  followed by all the rest of the company  she came into the hall  Jem modestly retired whilst they looked at his mats  but in a minute or two his mistress beckoned to him  and when he came into the middle of the circle  he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared   Well  said the lady  smiling   what do you see that makes you look so surprised   That all my mats are gone  said Jem   but you are very welcome   Are we  said the lady   well  take up your hat and go home then  for you see that it is getting late  and you know Lightfoot will wonder what  s become of you  Jem turned round to take up his hat  which he had left on the floor  But how his countenance changed  the hat was heavy with shillings  Everyone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings  so that for the eighteen mats he had got thirty  six shillings   Thirty  six shillings  said the lady   five and sevenpence I think you told me you had earned already  how much does that make  I must add  I believe  one other sixpence to make out your two guineas   Two guineas  exclaimed Jem  now quite conquering his bashfulness  for at the moment he forgot where he was  and saw nobody that was by   Two guineas  cried he  clapping his hands together  O  Lightfoot  O  mother  Then  recollecting himself  he saw his mistress  whom he now looked up to quite as a friend   Will YOU thank them all  said he  scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company   will YOU thank  em  for you know I don  t know how to thank  em RIGHTLY  Everybody thought  however  that they had been thanked RIGHTLY   Now we won  t keep you any longer  only  said his mistress   I have one thing to ask you  that I may be by when you show your treasure to your mother   Come  then  said Jem   come with me now   Not now  said the lady  laughing   but I will come to Ashton to  morrow evening  perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries   That she will  said Jem   I  ll search the garden myself  He now went home  but felt it a great restraint to wait till to  morrow evening before he told his mother  To console himself he flew to the stable  Lightfoot  you  re not to be sold on Monday  poor fellow  said he  patting him  and then could not refrain from counting out his money  Whilst he was intent upon this  Jem was startled by a noise at the door  somebody was trying to pull up the latch  It opened  and there came in Lazy Lawrence  with a boy in a red jacket  who had a cock under his arm  They started when they got into the middle of the stable  and when they saw Jem  who had been at first hidden by the horse   We  we  we came  stammered Lazy Lawrence  I mean  I came to  to  to   To ask you  continued the stable  boy  in a bold tone   whether you will go with us to the cock  fight on Monday  See  I  ve a fine cock here  and Lawrence told me you were a great friend of his  so I came  Lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of cock  fighting and in recommendation of his new companion  But Jem looked at the stable  boy with dislike  and a sort of dread  Then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion  said  in a low voice  to Lawrence   Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out   I don  t know  said Lawrence   as to that  but they say a cockfight  s a fine sight  and it  s no more cruel in me to go than another  and a great many go  and I  ve nothing else to do  so I shall go   But I have something else to do  said Jem  laughing   so I shall not go   But  continued Lawrence   you know Monday is the great Bristol fair  and one must be merry then  of all the days in the year   One day in the year  sure  there  s no harm in being merry  said the stable boy   I hope not  said Jem   for I know for my part  I am merry every day in the year   That  s very odd  said Lawrence   but I know for my part  I would not for all the world miss going to the fair  for at least it will be something to talk of for half a year after  Come  you  ll go  won  t you   No  said Jem  still looking as if he did not like to talk before the ill  looking stranger   Then what will you do with all your money   I  ll tell you about that another time  whispered Jem   and don  t you go to see that cock  s eyes pecked out  it won  t make you merry  I  m sure   If I had anything else to divert me  said Lawrence  hesitating and yawning   Come  cried the stable boy  seizing his stretching arm   come along  cried he  and  pulling him away from Jem  upon whom he cast a look of extreme contempt   leave him alone  he  s not the sort   What a fool you are  said he to Lawrence  the moment he got him out of the stable   you might have known he would not go  else we should soon have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence  But how came you to talk of four and sevenpence  I saw in the manger a hat full of silver   Indeed  exclaimed Lawrence   Yes  indeed  but why did you stammer so when we first got in  You had liked to have blown us all up   I was so ashamed  said Lawrence  hanging down his head   Ashamed  but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it  and I sha  n  t let you off  you owe us half a crown  recollect  and I must be paid to  night  so see and get the money somehow or other  After a considerable pause he added   I answer for it he  d never miss half a crown out of all that silver   But to steal  said Lawrence  drawing back with horror   I never thought I should come to that  and from poor Jem  too  the money that he has worked so hard for  too   But it is not stealing  we don  t mean to steal  only to borrow it  and if we win  which we certainly shall  at the cock  fight  pay it back again  and he  ll never know anything about the matter  and what harm will it do him  Besides  what signifies talking  you can  t go to the cock  fight  or the fair either  if you don  t  and I tell ye we don  t mean to steal it  we  ll pay it by Monday night  Lawrence made no reply  and they parted without his coming to any determination  Here let us pause in our story  We are almost afraid to go on  The rest is very shocking  Our little readers will shudder as they read  But it is better that they should know the truth  and see what the idle boy came to at last  In the dead of the night  Lawrence heard somebody tap at his window  He knew well who it was  for this was the signal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion  He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do  and lay quite still  with his head under the bedclothes  till he heard the second tap  Then he got up  dressed himself  and opened his window  It was almost even with the ground  His companion said to him  in a hollow voice   Are you ready  He made no answer  but got out of the window and followed  When he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon  and it was quite dark   Where are you  whispered Lawrence  groping about   where are you  Speak to me   I am here  give me your hand  Lawrence stretched out his hand   Is that your hand  said the wicked boy  as Lawrence laid hold of him   how cold it feels   Let us go back  said Lawrence   it is time yet   It is no time to go back  replied the other  opening the door   you  ve gone too far now to go back  and he pushed Lawrence into the stable   Have you found it  Take care of the horse  Have you done  What are you about  Make haste  I hear a noise  said the stable boy  who watched at the door   I am feeling for the half  crown  but I can  t find it   Bring all together  He brought Jem  s broken flower pot  with all the money in it  to the door  The black cloud had now passed over the moon  and the light shone full upon them   What do we stand here for  said the stable boy  snatching the flower  pot out of Lawrence  s trembling hands  and pulled him away from the door   Good God  cried Lawrence   you won  t take all  You said you  d only take half a crown  and pay it back on Monday  You said you  d only take half a crown   Hold your tongue  replied the other  walking on  deaf to all remonstrances  if ever I am to be hanged  it sha  n  t be for half a crown  Lawrence  s blood ran cold in his veins  and he felt as if all his hair stood on end  Not another word passed  His accomplice carried off the money  and Lawrence crept  with all the horrors of guilt upon him  to his restless bed  All night he was starting from frightful dreams  or else  broad awake  he lay listening to every small noise  unable to stir  and scarcely daring to breathe  tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear  that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience  He thought the morning would never come  but when it was day  when he heard the birds sing  and saw everything look cheerful as usual  he felt still more miserable  It was Sunday morning  and the bell rang for church  All the children of the village  dressed in their Sunday clothes  innocent and gay  and little Jem  the best and gayest amongst them  went flocking by his door to church   Well  Lawrence  said Jem  pulling his coat as he passed and saw Lawrence leaning against his father  s door   what makes you look so black   I  said Lawrence  starting   why do you say that I look black   Nay  then  said Jem   you look white enough now  if that will please you  for you  re turned as pale as death   Pale  replied Lawrence  not knowing what he said  and turned abruptly away  for he dared not stand another look of Jem  s  conscious that guilt was written in his face  he shunned every eye  He would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind  He longed to follow Jem  to fall upon his knees and confess all  Dreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss  Lawrence dared not stay at home  and not knowing what to do  or where to go  he mechanically went to his old haunt at the stable yard  and lurked thereabouts all day with his accomplice  who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his spirits by talking of the next day  s cock  fight  It was agreed that as soon as the dusk of the evening came on  they should go together into a certain lonely field  and there divide their booty  In the meantime  Jem  when he returned from church  was very full of business  preparing for the reception of his mistress  of whose intended visit he had informed his mother  and whilst she was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour  he ran to search the strawberry beds   Why  my Jem  how merry you are to  day  said his mother  when he came in with the strawberries  and was jumping about the room playfully   Now  keep those spirits of yours  Jem  till you want  em  and don  t let it come upon you all at once  Have it in mind that to  morrow  s fair day  and Lightfoot must go  I bid Farmer Truck call for him to  night  He said he  d take him along with his own  and he  ll be here just now  and then I know how it will be with you  Jem   So do I  cried Jem  swallowing his secret with great difficulty  and then tumbling head over heels four times running  A carriage passed the window  and stopped at the door  Jem ran out  it was his mistress  She came in smiling  and soon made the old woman smile  too  by praising the neatness of everything in the house  We shall pass over  however important as they were deemed at the time  the praises of the strawberries  and of  my grandmother  s china plate  Another knock was heard at the door   Run  Jem  said his mother   I hope it  s our milk  woman with cream for the lady  No  it was Farmer Truck come for Lightfoot  The old woman  s countenance fell   Fetch him out  dear  said she  turning to her son  but Jem was gone  he flew out to the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck  s great  coat   Sit ye down  farmer  said the old woman  after they had waited about five minutes in expectation of Jem  s return   You  d best sit down  if the lady will give you leave  for he  ll not hurry himself back again  My boy  s a fool  madam  about that there horse  Trying to laugh  she added   I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part  He won  t bring him out till the last minute  so do sit ye down  neighbour  The farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem  with a pale  wild countenance came back   What  s the matter  said his mistress   God bless the boy  said his mother  looking at him quite frightened  whilst he tried to speak  but could not  She went up to him  and then leaning his head against her  he cried   It  s gone  it  s all gone  and  bursting into tears  he sobbed as if his little heart would break   What  s gone  love  said his mother   My two guineas  Lightfoot  s two guineas  I went to fetch  em to give you  mammy  but the broken flower  pot that I put them in  and all  s gone  quite gone  repeated he  checking his sobs   I saw them safe last night  and was showing  em to Lightfoot  and I was so glad to think I had earned them all myself  and I thought how surprised you  d look  and how glad you  d be  and how you  d kiss me  and all  His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise  whilst his mistress stood in silence  looking first at the old woman  and then at Jem with a penetrating eye  as if she suspected the truth of his story  and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion   This is a very strange thing  said she  gravely   How came you to leave all your money in a broken flower  pot in the stable  How came you not to give it to your mother to take care of   Why  don  t you remember  said Jem  looking up  in the midst of his tears  why  don  t you remember you  your own self  bid me not tell her about it till you were by   And did you not tell her   Nay  ask mammy  said Jem  a little offended  and when afterwards the lady went on questioning him in a severe manner  as if she did not believe him  he at last made no answer   Oh  Jem  Jem  why don  t you speak to the lady  said his mother   I have spoke  and spoke the truth  said Jem  proudly   and she did not believe me  Still the lady  who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion  maintained a cold manner  and determined to wait the event without interfering  saying only  that she hoped the money would be found  and advised Jem to have done crying   I have done  said Jem   I shall cry no more  And as he had the greatest command over himself  he actually did not shed another tear  not even when the farmer got up to go  saying  he could wait no longer  Jem silently went to bring out Lightfoot  The lady now took her seat  where she could see all that passed at the open parlour  window  The old woman stood at the door  and several idle people of the village  who had gathered round the lady  s carriage examining it  turned about to listen  In a minute or two Jem appeared  with a steady countenance  leading Lightfoot and  when he came up  without saying a word  put the bridle into Farmer Truck  s hand   He HAS BEEN a good horse  said the farmer   He IS a good horse  cried Jem  and threw his arm over Lightfoot  s neck  hiding his own face as he leaned upon him  At this instant a party of milk  women went by  and one of them  having set down her pail  came behind Jem  and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back  He looked up   And don  t you know me  said she   I forget  said Jem   I think I have seen your face before  but I forget   Do you so  and you  ll tell me just now  said she  half opening her hand   that you forget who gave you this  and who charged you not to part with it  too  Here she quite opened her large hand  and on the palm of it appeared Jem  s silver penny   Where  exclaimed Jem  seizing it   oh  where did you find it  and have you  oh  tell me  have you got the rest of my money   I know nothing of your money  I don  t know what you would be at  said the milk  woman   But where  pray tell me where  did you find this   With them that you gave it to  I suppose  said the milk  woman  turning away suddenly to take up her milk  pail  But now Jem  s mistress called to her through the window  begging her to stop  and joining in his entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny   Why  madam  said she  taking up the corner of her apron   I came by it in an odd way  too  You must know my Betty is sick  so I came with the milk myself  though it  s not what I  m used to  for my Betty  you know my Betty  said she  turning round to the old woman   my Betty serves you  and she  s a tight and stirring lassy  ma  am  I can assure   Yes  I don  t doubt it  said the lady  impatiently   but about the silver penny   Why  that  s true  as I was coming along all alone  for the rest came round  and I came a short cut across yon field  no  you can  t see it  madam  where you stand  but if you were here   I see it  I know it  said Jem  out of breath with anxiety   Well  well  I rested my pail upon the stile  and sets me down awhile  and there comes out of the hedge  I don  t know well how  for they startled me so I  d liked to have thrown down my milk  two boys  one about the size of he  said she pointing to Jem   and one a matter taller  but ill  looking like  so I did not think to stir to make way for them  and they were like in a desperate hurry  so  without waiting for the stile  one of  em pulled at the gate  and when it would not open ( for it was tied with a pretty stout cord ) one of  em whips out with his knife and cuts it  Now  have you a knife about you  sir  continued the milk woman to the farmer  He gave her his knife   Here  now  ma  am  just sticking  as it were here  between the blade and the haft  was the silver penny  The lad took no notice  but when he opened it  out it falls  Still he takes no heed  but cuts the cord  as I said before  and through the gate they went  and out of sight in half a minute  I picks up the penny  for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a long time  and had given against my voice to he  pointing to Jem   and I charged him not to part with it  and  ma  am  when I looked I knew it by the mark  so I thought I would show it to HE  again pointing to Jem   and let him give it back to those it belongs to   It belongs to me  said Jem   I never gave it to anybody  but   But  cried the farmer   those boys have robbed him  it is they who have all his money   Oh  which way did they go  cried Jem   I  ll run after them   No  no  said the lady  calling to her servant  and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them   Ay  added Farmer Truck   do you take the road  and I  ll take the field way  and I  ll be bound we  ll have  em presently  Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves  the lady  who was now thoroughly convinced of Jem  s truth  desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening  Out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and bridle  How Jem  s eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon Lightfoot  s back   Put it on your horse yourself  Jem  said the lady   it is yours  Confused reports of Lightfoot  s splendid accoutrements  of the pursuit of thieves  and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at Dame Preston  s window  quickly spread through the village  and drew everybody from their houses  They crowded round Jem to hear the story  The children especially  who were fond of him  expressed the strongest indignation against the thieves  Every eye was on the stretch  and now some  who had run down the lane  came back shouting   Here they are  they  ve got the thieves  The footman on horseback carried one boy before him  and the farmer  striding along  dragged another  The latter had on a red jacket  which little Jem immediately recollected  and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback   Good God  said he to himself   it must be  yet surely it can  t be Lawrence  The footman rode on as fast as the people would let him  The boy  s hat was slouched  and his head hung down  so that nobody could see his face  At this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd  A man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards  swearing that nobody should stop him  that he had a right to see  and he WOULD see  And so he did  for  forcing through all resistance  he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting down the boy he had carried before him   I WILL  I tell you I WILL see the thief  cried the drunken man  pushing up the boy  s hat  It was his own son   Lawrence  exclaimed the wretched father  The shock sobered him at once  and he hid his face in his hands  There was an awful silence  Lawrence fell on his knees  and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt   Such a young creature so wicked  the bystanders exclaimed   what could put such wickedness in your head   Bad company  said Lawrence   And how came you  what brought you into bad company   I don  t know  except it was idleness  While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence  s pockets  and when the money appeared  all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror  Their parents grasped their little hands closer  and cried   Thank God  he is not my son  How often when he was little we used  as he lounged about  to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil  As for the hardened wretch  his accomplice  everyone was impatient to have him sent to gaol  He put on a bold  insolent countenance  till he heard Lawrence  s confession  till the money was found upon him  and he heard the milk  woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had dropped  Then he turned pale  and betrayed the strongest signs of fear   We must take him before the justice  said the farmer   and he  ll be lodged in Bristol gaol   Oh  said Jem  springing forwards when Lawrence  s hands were going to be tied   let him go  won  t you  can  t you let him go   Yes  madam  for mercy  s sake  said Jem  s mother to the lady   think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol  His father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair   It  s all my fault  cried he   I brought him up in idleness   But he  ll never be idle any more  said Jem   won  t you speak for him  ma  am   Don  t ask the lady to speak for him  said the farmer   it  s better he should go to Bridewell now  than to the gallows by  and  by  Nothing more was said  for everybody felt the truth of the farmer  s speech  Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month  and the stable  boy was sent for trial  convicted  and transported to Botany Bay  During Lawrence  s confinement  Jem often visited him  and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give  and Jem could afford to be GENEROUS  because he was INDUSTRIOUS  Lawrence  s heart was touched by his kindness  and his example struck him so forcibly that  when his confinement was ended  he resolved to set immediately to work  and  to the astonishment of all who knew him  soon became remarkable for industry  He was found early and late at his work  established a new character  and for ever lost the name of  Lazy Lawrence  THE FALSE KEY  Mr  Spencer  a very benevolent and sensible man  undertook the education of several poor children  Among the rest was a boy of the name of Franklin  whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old  Franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character  and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child  When any of the neighbours  children quarrelled with him  they used to tell him that he would turn out like his father  But Mr  Spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased  that by behaving well he would certainly  sooner or later  secure the esteem and love of all who knew him  even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his father  s account  This hope was very delightful to Franklin  and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right  so that Mr  Spencer soon grew fond of him  and took great pains to instruct him  and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful  respectable and happy man  When he was about thirteen years of age  Mr  Spencer one day sent for him into his closet  and as he was folding up a letter which he had been writing  said to him  with a very kind look  but in a graver tone than usual   Franklin  you are going to leave me   Sir  said Franklin   You are now going to leave me  and to begin the world for yourself  You will carry this letter to my sister  Mrs  Churchill  in Queen  s Square  You know Queen  s Square  Franklin bowed   You must expect  continued Mr  Spencer   to meet with several disagreeable things  and a great deal of rough work  at your first setting out  but be faithful and obedient to your mistress  and obliging to your fellow  servants  and all will go well  Mrs  Churchill will make you a very good mistress  if you behave properly  and I have no doubt but you will   Thank you  sir   And you will always  I mean  as long as you deserve it  find a friend in me   Thank you  sir  I am sure you are  There Franklin stopped short  for the recollection of all Mr  Spencer  s goodness rushed upon him at once  and he could not say another word   Bring me a candle to seal this letter  said his master  and he was very glad to get out of the room  He came back with the candle  and  with a stout heart  stood by whilst the letter was sealing  and  when his master put it into his hand  said  in a cheerful voice   I hope you will let me see you again  sir  sometimes   Certainly  whenever your mistress can spare you  I shall be very glad to see you  and remember  if ever you get into any difficulty  don  t be afraid to come to me  I have sometimes spoken harshly to you  but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend  Franklin at this turned away with a full heart  and  after making two or three attempts to express his gratitude  left the room without being able to speak  He got to Queen  s Square about three o  clock  The door was opened by a large  red  faced man  in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat  to whom he felt afraid to give his message  lest he should not be a servant   Well  what  s your business  sir  said the butler   I have a letter for Mrs  Churchill  sir  said Franklin  endeavouring to pronounce his  sir  in a tone as respectful as the butler  s was insolent  The man having examined the direction  seal  and edges of the letter  carried it upstairs  and in a few minutes returned  and ordered Franklin to rub his shoes well and follow him  He was then shown into a handsome room  where he found his mistress  an elderly lady  She asked him a few questions  examining him attentively as she spoke  and her severe eye at first  and her gracious smile afterwards  made him feel that she was a person to be both loved and feared   I shall give you in charge  said she  ringing a bell   to my housekeeper  and I hope she will have no reason to be displeased with you  The housekeeper  when she first came in  appeared with a smiling countenance  but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin  it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion  Her mistress recommended him to her protection  saying   Pomfret  I hope you will keep this boy under your own eye  And she received him with a cold  Very well  ma  am  which plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him  In fact  Mrs  Pomfret was a woman so fond of power  and so jealous of favour  that she would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without her introduction  She smothered her displeasure  however  till night  when  as she attended her mistress  toilette  she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments  She began cautiously   Ma  am  is not this the boy Mr  Spencer was talking of one day  that has been brought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY  I think they call it   Philanthropic Society  yes  said her mistress   and my brother gives him a high character  I hope he will do very well   I  m sure I hope so too  observed Mrs  Pomfret   but I can  t say  for my part  I  ve no great notion of those low people  They say all those children are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town  and surely they are like enough  ma  am  to take after their own fathers and mothers   But they are not suffered to be with their parents  rejoined the lady   and therefore cannot be hurt by their example  This little boy  to be sure  was unfortunate in his father  but he has had an excellent education   Oh  EDICATION  to be sure  ma  am  I know  I don  t say but what edication is a great thing  But then  ma  am  edication can  t change the NATUR that  s in one  they say  and one  s that born naturally bad and low  they say  all the edication in the world won  t do no good  and  for my part  ma  am  I know you knows best  but I should be afraid to let any of those Villaintropic folks get into my house  for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand  I declare it frights me   Pomfret  I thought you had better sense  how would this poor boy earn his bread  he would be forced to starve or steal  if everybody had such prejudices  Pomfret  who really was a good woman  was softened at this idea  and said   God forbid he should starve or steal  and God forbid I should say anything PREJUDICIARY of the boy  for there may be no harm in him   Well  said Mrs  Churchill  changing her tone   but  Pomfret  if we don  t like the boy at the end of the month  we have done with him  for I have only promised Mr  Spencer to keep him a month upon trial  there is no harm done   Dear  no  ma  am  to be sure  and cook must put up with her disappointment  that  s all   What disappointment   About her nephew  ma  am  the boy she and I was speaking to you for   When   The day you called her up about the almond pudding  ma  am  If you remember  you said you should have no objections to try the boy  and upon that cook bought him new shirts  but they are to the good  as I tell her   But I did not promise to take her nephew   O  no ma  am  not at all  she does not think to SAY THAT  else I should be very angry  but the poor woman never let fall a word  any more than frets that the boy should miss such a good place   Well  but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him  I shall keep my word  let him come to  morrow  Let them both have a fair trial  and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best  and which we had better keep  Dismissed with these orders  Mrs  Pomfret hastened to report all that had passed to the cook  like a favourite minister  proud to display the extent of her secret influence  In the morning Felix  the cook  s nephew  arrived  and  the moment he came into the kitchen  every eye  even the scullion  s  was fixed upon him with approbation  and afterwards glanced upon Franklin with contempt  contempt which Franklin could not endure without some confusion  though quite unconscious of having deserved it  nor  upon the most impartial and cool self  examination  could he comprehend the justice of his judges  He perceived indeed  for the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers  that Felix was a much handsomer  or as the kitchen maid expressed it  a much more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was  and he was made to understand  that he wanted a frill to his shirt  a cravat  a pair of thin shoes  and  above all  shoe strings  besides other nameless advantages  which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen  However  upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr  Spencer had ever said to him  he could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant  so that he could only comfort himself with resolving  if possible  to make amends for these deficiencies  and to dissipate the prejudices which he saw were formed against him  by the strictest adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty  He hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all her commands  and faithful care of all that belonged to her  At the same time he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them  He pursued this plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks  and found that he succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress  but unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants  and he sometimes offended when he least expected it  He had made great progress in the affections of Corkscrew  the butler  by working indeed very hard for him  and doing every day at least half his business  But one unfortunate night the butler was gone out  the bell rang  he went upstairs  and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was  he answered that he was gone out   Where to  said his mistress   I don  t know  answered Franklin  And  as he had told exactly the truth  and meant to do no harm  he was surprised  at the butler  s return  when he repeated to him what had passed  at receiving a sudden box on the ear  and the appellation of a mischievous  impertinent  mean  spirited brat   Mischievous  impertinent  mean  repeated Franklin to himself  but  looking in the butler  s face  which was a deeper scarlet than usual  he judged that he was far from sober  and did not doubt but that the next morning  when he came to the use of his reason  he would be sensible of his injustice  and apologize for his box of the ear  But no apology coming all day  Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation  or rather  to ask what he had best do on the next occasion   Why  said Corkscrew   when mistress asked for me  how came you to say I was gone out   Because  you know  I saw you go out   And when she asked you where I was gone  how came you to say that you did not know   Because  indeed  I did not   You are a stupid blockhead  could you not say I was gone to the washerwoman  s   But WERE you  said Franklin   Was I  cried Corkscrew  and looked as if he would have struck him again   how dare you give me the lie  Mr  Hypocrite  You would be ready enough  I  ll be bound  to make excuses for yourself  Why are not mistress  clogs cleaned  Go along and blacken  em  this minute  and send Felix to me  From this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler  s pantry  Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew  and  though Franklin by no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences  nor ever entered without knocking at the door  yet it was his fate once to be sent of a message at an unlucky time  and  as the door was half open  he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor  which he could not help suspecting to be wine  and  as the decanter  which usually went upstairs after dinner  was at this time in the butler  s grasp  without any stopper in it  he was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his mistress  wine  Nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix received  his aunt  the cook  had occasion for his assistance  and she had many delicious douceurs in her gift  Many a handful of currants  many a half  custard  many a triangular remnant of pie  besides the choice of his own meal at breakfast  dinner and supper  fell to the share of the favourite Felix  whilst Franklin was neglected  though he took the utmost pains to please the cook in all honourable service  and  when she was hot  angry  or hurried  he was always at hand to help her  and in the hour of adversity  when the clock struck five  and no dinner was dished  and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had  Franklin would answer to her call  with flowers to garnish her dishes  and presence of mind to know  in the midst of the commotion  where everything that was wanting was to be found  so that  quick as lightning  all difficulties vanished before him  Yet when the danger was over  and the hour of adversity had past  the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor  and  when it came to his supper time  would throw him  with a carelessness that touched him sensibly  anything which the other servants were too nice to eat  All this Franklin bore with fortitude  nor did he envy Felix the dainties which he ate  sometimes close beside him   For  said he to himself   I have a clear conscience  and that is more than Felix can have  I know how he wins cook  s favour too well  and I fancy I know how I have offended her  for since the day I saw the basket  she has done nothing but huff me  The history of the basket was this  Mrs  Pomfret  the housekeeper  had several times  directly and indirectly  given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late  Now  when she spoke  it was usually at dinner time  she always looked  or Franklin imagined that she looked  suspiciously at him  Other people looked more maliciously  but  as he felt himself perfectly innocent  he went on eating his dinner in silence  But at length it was time to explain  One Sunday there appeared a handsome sirloin of beef  which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone  and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of Mrs  Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst forth  and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul play  and she would have the beef found  or she would know why  She spoke  but no beef appeared  till Franklin  with a look of sudden recollection  cried   Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a basket in the dairy  I think  The cook  as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow  grew pale  but  suddenly recovering the use of her speech  turned upon Franklin  and  with a voice of thunder  gave him the lie direct  and forthwith  taking Mrs  Pomfret by the ruffle  led the way to the dairy  declaring she could defy the world  that so she could  and would   There  ma  am  said she kicking an empty basket which lay on the floor  there  s malice for you  Ask him why he don  t show you the beef in the basket   I thought I saw  poor Franklin began   You thought you saw  cried the cook  coming close up to him with kimboed arms  and looking like a dragon   and pray  sir  what business has such a one as you to think you see  And pray  ma  am  will you be pleased to speak  perhaps  ma  am  he  ll condescend to obey you  ma  am  will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy  for here he comes prying and spying about  and how  ma  am  am I to answer for my butter and cream  or anything at all  I  m sure it  s what I can  t pretend to  unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places  Mrs  Pomfret  whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks of the  Villaintropic Society  and also by her secret jealousy of a boy whom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress  took part with the cook  and ended  as she began  with a firm persuasion that Franklin was the guilty person   Let him alone  let him alone  said she   he has as many turns and windings as a hare  but we shall catch him yet  I  ll be bound  in some of his doublings  I knew the nature of him well enough  from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him  but mistress shall have her own way  and see the end of it  These words  and the bitter sense of injustice  drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of Franklin  which might possibly have touched Mrs  Pomfret  if Felix  with a sneer  had not called them CROCODILE TEARS   Felix  too  thought he   this is too much  In fact  Felix had till now professed himself his firm ally  and had on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship  for it must be told that every other morning  when it was Felix  s turn to get breakfast  Felix never was up in decent time  and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if Franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him  the bread and butter spread  and the toast toasted  and had not  moreover  regularly  when the clock struck eight  and Mrs  Pomfret  s foot was heard overhead  run to call the sleeping Felix  and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs  All this could not but be present to his memory  but  seeming to reproach him  Franklin wiped away his crocodile tears  and preserved a magnanimous silence  The hour of retribution was  however  not so far off as Felix imagined  Cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time  but although they may escape once  twice  perhaps ninety  nine times  what does that signify  for the hundredth time they come to shame  and lose all their character  Grown bold by frequent success  Felix became more careless in his operations  and it happened that one day he met his mistress full in the passage  as he was going on one of the cook  s secret errands   Where are you going  Felix  said his mistress   To the washerwoman  s  ma  am  answered he  with his usual effrontery   Very well  said she   Call at the bookseller  s in  stay  I must write down the direction  Pomfret  said she  opening the housekeeper  s room door   have you a bit of paper  Pomfret came with the writing  paper  and looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her knowledge  so  while Mrs  Churchill was writing the direction  she stood talking to him about it  whilst he  in the greatest terror imaginable  looked up in her face as she spoke  but was all the time intent on parrying on the other side the attacks of a little French dog of his mistress  which  unluckily for him  had followed her into the passage  Manchon was extremely fond of Felix  who  by way of pleasing his mistress  had paid most assiduous court to her dog  yet now his caresses were rather troublesome  Manchon leaped up  and was not to be rebuffed   Poor fellow  poor fellow  down  down  poor fellow  cried Felix  and put him away  But Manchon leaped up again  and began smelling near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner   You will see by this direction where you are to go  said his mistress   Manchon  come here  and you will be so good as to bring me  down  down  Manchon  be quiet  But Manchon knew better  he had now got his head into Felix  s pocket  and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence  rustling out of its brown paper  half a cold turkey  which had been missing since morning   My cold turkey  as I  m alive  exclaimed the housekeeper  darting upon it with horror and amazement   What is all this  said Mrs  Churchill  in a composed voice   I don  t know  ma  am  answered Felix  so confused that he knew not what to say   but   But what  cried Mrs  Pomfret  indignation flashing from her eyes   But what  repeated his mistress  waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention  which still more disconcerted Felix  for  though with an angry person he might have some chance of escape  he knew that he could not invent any excuse in such circumstances  which could stand the examination of a person in her sober senses  He was struck dumb   Speak  said Mrs  Churchill  in a still lower tone   I am ready to hear all you have to say  In my house everybody shall have justice  speak  but what   BUT  stammered Felix  and  after in vain attempting to equivocate  confessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousin  s  but he threw all the blame upon his aunt  the cook  who  he said  had ordered him upon this expedition  The cook was now summoned  but she totally denied all knowledge of the affair  with the same violence with which she had lately confounded Franklin about the beef in the basket  not entirely  however  with the same success  for Felix  perceiving by his mistress  eye that she was on the point of desiring him to leave the house immediately  and not being very willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the butler  did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her own  He knew how to bring his charge home to her  He produced a note in her own handwriting  the purport of which was to request her cousin  s acceptance of  some DELICATE COLD TURKEY  and to beg she would send her  by the return of the bearer  a little of her cherry  brandy  Mrs  Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook  s discharge  and informed Felix she had no further occasion for his services  but  upon his pleading with many tears  which Franklin did not call CROCODILE TEARS  that he was so young  that he was under the dominion of his aunt  he touched Mrs  Pomfret  s compassion  and she obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month  to give him yet a chance of redeeming his character  Mrs  Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon  resolved  for the future  to be more upon her guard with Felix  and felt that she had treated Franklin with great injustice  when she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef  Good people  when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone with injustice  are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mistake  and Mrs  Pomfret was now prepared to see everything which Franklin did in the most favourable point of view  especially as the next day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for her tea  and buttered her toast  services for which she had always thought she was indebted to Felix  Besides  she had rated Felix  s abilities very highly  because he made up her weekly accounts for her  but unluckily once  when Franklin was out of the way  and she brought a bill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up  she discovered that he did not know how to cast up pounds  shillings and pence  and he was obliged to confess that she must wait till Franklin came home  But  passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded the character of the two boys  we must proceed to a more serious affair  Corkscrew frequently  after he had finished taking away supper  and after the housekeeper was gone to bed  sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse to drink with his friends  The alehouse was kept by that cousin of Felix  s  who was so fond of  DELICATE cold turkey  and who had such choice cherry  brandy  Corkscrew kept the key of the house door  so that he could return home whenever he thought proper  and  if he should by accident be called for by his mistress after supper  Felix knew where to find him  and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor Franklin had too much integrity to use  All these precautions taken  the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite passion  which so increased with indulgence  that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life  Every day he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits  for every day drinking became more necessary to him  His health was ruined  With a red  pimpled  bloated face  emaciated legs  and a swelled  diseased body  he appeared the victim of intoxication  In the morning  when he got up  his hands trembled  his spirits flagged  he could do nothing until he had taken a dram  an operation which he was obliged to repeat several times in the course of the day  as all those wretched people MUST who once acquire this habit  He had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented  and the landlord  who grew urgent for his money  refused to give further credit  One night  when Corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful  he leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table  began to quarrel with the landlord  and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman  To which the landlord coolly replied   That as long as he had paid like a gentleman  he had been treated like one  and that was as much as anyone could expect  or  at any rate  as much as anyone would meet with in this world  For the truth of this assertion he appealed  laughing  to a party of men who were drinking in the room  The men  however  took part with Corkscrew  and  drawing him over to their table  made him sit down with them  They were in high good  humour  and the butler soon grew so intimate with them  that  in the openness of his heart  he soon communicated to them  not only all his own affairs  but all that he knew  and more than all that he knew  of his mistress  His new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation  and encouraged him as much as possible to talk  for they had secret views  which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover  Mrs  Churchill had some fine old family plate  and these men belonged to a gang of housebreakers  Before they parted with Corkscrew  they engaged him to meet them again the next night  their intimacy was still more closely cemented  One of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew three guineas towards the payment of his debt  and hinted that  if he thought proper  he could easily get the whole cleared off  Upon this hint  Corkscrew became all attention  till  after some hesitation on their part  and repeated promises of secrecy on his  they at length disclosed their plans to him  They gave him to understand  that if he would assist in letting them into his mistress  house  they would let him have an ample share in the booty  The butler  who had the reputation of being an honest man  and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against everything but his mistress  port  turned pale  and trembled at this proposal  drank two or three bumpers to drown thought  and promised to give an answer the next day  He went home more than half  intoxicated  His mind was so full of what had passed  that he could not help bragging to Felix  whom he found awake at his return  that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased  dropping  besides  some hints  which were not lost upon Felix  In the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had said  and Corkscrew  alarmed  endeavoured to evade his questions  by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that manner  Nothing  however  that he could urge made any impression upon Felix  whose recollection on the subject was perfectly distinct  and who had too much cunning himself  and too little confidence in his companion  to be the dupe of his dissimulation  The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme  or to become a sharer in the booty  The next night came  and he was now to make a final decision  either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances  or taking Felix with him to join in the plot  His debt  his love of drinking  the impossibility of indulging it without a fresh supply of money  all came into his mind at once  and conquered his remaining scruples  It is said by those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed  that a drunkard will sacrifice anything  everything  sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication  How much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through it when once formed  The hour of rendezvous came  and Corkscrew went to the alehouse  where he found the housebreakers waiting for him  and a glass of brandy ready poured out  He sighed  drank  hesitated  drank again  heard the landlord talk of his bill  saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment  drank again  cursed himself  and  giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear  swore that he could not help it  and must do as they would have him  They required of him to give up the key of the house door  that they might get another made by it  He had left it with Felix  and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen  Felix knew enough to ruin them  and must therefore be won over  This was no very difficult task  he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats  and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe  The cravats were bought and shown to Felix  He thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete  fine gentleman  and to go without them  especially when he had once seen himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow  appeared impossible  Even this paltry temptation  working upon his vanity  at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood  It was agreed that  the first time his mistress sent him out on a message  he should carry the key of the house door to his cousin  s  and deliver it into the hands of one of the gang  who were there in waiting for it  Such was the scheme  Felix  the night after all this had been planned  went to bed  and fell fast asleep  but the butler  who had not yet stifled the voice of conscience  felt  in the silence of the night  so insupportably miserable  that  instead of going to rest  he stole softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistress  wine  and there drinking glass after glass  he stayed till he became so far intoxicated  that  though he contrived to find his way back to bed  he could by no means undress himself  Without any power of recollection  he flung himself upon the bed  leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him  Franklin slept in the next room to him  and presently awaking  thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning  He jumped up  and seeing a light under the butler  s door  gently opened it  and to his astonishment  beheld one of the bed curtains in flames  He immediately ran to the butler  and pulled him with all his force  to rouse him from his lethargy  He came to his senses at length  but was so terrified  and so helpless  that  if it had not been for Franklin  the whole house would soon inevitably have been on fire  Felix  trembling and cowardly  knew not what to do  and it was curious to see him obeying Franklin  whose turn it now was to command  Franklin ran upstairs to awaken Mrs  Pomfret  whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses  whilst he  with the greatest presence of mind  recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water  which the maids had prepared the night before for their washing  and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak  he threw them upon the flames  He exerted himself with so much good sense  that the fire was presently extinguished  Everything was now once more safe and quiet  Mrs  Pomfret  recovering from her fright  postponed all inquiries till the morning  and rejoiced that her mistress had not been awakened  whilst Corkscrew flattered himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident   Don  t you tell Mrs  Pomfret where you found the candle when you came into the room  said he to Franklin   If she asks me  you know I must tell the truth  replied he   Must  repeated Felix  sneeringly   what  you MUST be a tell  tale   No  I never told any tales of anybody  and I should be very sorry to get anyone into a scrape  but for all that I shall not tell a lie  either for myself or anybody else  let you call me what names you will   But if I were to give you something that you would like  said Corkscrew  something that I know you would like  repeated Felix   Nothing you can give me will do  answered Franklin  steadily   so it is useless to say any more about it  I hope I shall not be questioned  In this hope he was mistaken  for the first thing Mrs  Pomfret did in the morning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains  whilst Corkscrew stood by  endeavouring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could invent  Mrs  Pomfret  however  though sometimes blinded by her prejudices  was no fool  and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle  which had been left on the hearth  where Corkscrew protested he had left it  could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant  Turning short round to Franklin  she desired that he would show her where he found the candle when he came into the room  He took up the candlestick  but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it  she snatched it from his hands   How did this candlestick come here  This was not the candlestick you found here last night  cried she   Yes  indeed it was  answered Franklin   That is impossible  retorted she  vehemently   for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night  in the hall  the last thing I did  after you  said she  turning to the butler   was gone to bed  I  m sure of it  Nay  don  t you recollect my taking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand  and making you to go up to bed with the brass one  and I bolted the door at the stair  head after you  This was all very true  but Corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his room by a back staircase  unbolted that door  and  upon his return from the alehouse  had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs  and had left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table   Oh  ma  am  said Felix   indeed you forget  for Mr  Corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning  and I happened to take particular notice  and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand  and that was just as I heard you  bolting the door  Indeed  ma  am you forget   Indeed  sir  retorted Mrs  Pomfret  rising in anger   I do not forget  I  m not come to be SUPPERANNUATED yet  I hope  How do you dare to tell me I forget   Oh  ma  am  cried Felix   I beg your pardon  I did not  I did not mean to say you forgot  but only I thought  perhaps  you might not particularly remember  for if you please to recollect   I won  t please to recollect just whatever you please  sir  Hold your tongue  why should you poke yourself into this scrape  what have you to do with it  I should be glad to know   Nothing in the world  oh nothing in the world  I  m sure I beg your pardon  ma  am  answered Felix  in a soft tone  and  sneaking off  left his friend Corkscrew to fight his own battle  secretly resolving to desert in good time  if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions coming to light  Corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and  conscious of guilt  he turned pale  and appeared so much more terrified than butlers usually appear when detected in a lie  that Mrs  Pomfret resolved  as she said  to sift the matter to the bottom  Impatiently did she wait till the clock struck nine  and her mistress  bell rang  the signal for her attendance at her levee   How do you find yourself this morning  ma  am  said she  undrawing the curtains   Very sleepy  indeed  answered her mistress in a drowsy voice   I think I must sleep half an hour longer  shut the curtains   As you please  ma  am  but I suppose I had better open a little of the window shutter  for it  s past nine   But just struck   Oh dear  ma  am  it struck before I came upstairs  and you know we are twenty minutes slow  Lord bless us  exclaimed Mrs  Pomfret  as she let fall the bar of the window  which roused her mistress   I  m sure I beg your pardon a thousand times  it  s only the bar  because I had this great key in my hand   Put down the key  then  or you  ll knock something else down  and you may open the shutters now  for I  m quite awake   Dear me  I  m so sorry to think of disturbing you  cried Mrs  Pomfret  at the same time throwing the shutters wide open   but  to be sure  ma  am  I have something to tell you  which won  t let you sleep again in a hurry  I brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my own  which I  m sure you  ll approve of  but I  m not come to that part of my story yet  I hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night  ma  am   I heard no noise   I am surprised at that  though  continued Mrs  Pomfret  and proceeded to give a most ample account of the fire  of her fears  and her suspicions   To be sure  ma  am  what I say IS  that  without the spirit of prophecy  one can nowadays account for what has passed  I  m quite clear in my own judgment  that Mr  Corkscrew must have been out last night after I went to bed  for  besides the japanned candlestick  which of itself I  m sure is strong enough to hang a man  there  s another circumstance  ma  am  that certifies it to me  though I have not mentioned it  ma  am  to no one yet  lowering her voice  Franklin  when I questioned him  told me  that he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night  and this morning it was on the kitchen table  Now  ma  am  that lantern could not come without hands  and I could not forget about that  you know  for Franklin says  he  s sure he left the lantern out   And do you believe HIM  inquired her mistress   To be sure  ma  am  how can I help believing him  I never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house  so one can  t help believing in him  like him or not   Without meaning to tell a falsehood  however  said the lady   he might make a mistake   No  ma  am  he never makes mistakes  it is not his way to go gossiping and tattling  he never tells anything till he  s asked  and then it  s fit he should  About the sirloin of beef  and all  he was right in the end  I found  to do him justice  and I  m sure he  s right now about the lantern  he  s ALWAY  S RIGHT  Mrs  Churchill could not help smiling   If you had seen him  ma  am  last night in the midst of the fire  I  m sure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds  and I shall never forget his coming to call me  Poor fellow  he that I was always scolding and scolding  enough to make him hate me  But he  s too good to hate anybody  and I  ll be bound I  ll make it up to him now   Take care that you don  t go from one extreme into another  Pomfret  don  t spoil the boy   No  ma  am  there  s no danger of that  but I  m sure if you had seen him last night yourself  you would think he deserved to be rewarded   And so he shall be rewarded  said Mrs  Churchill   but I will try him more fully yet   There  s no occasion  I think  for trying him any more  ma  am  said Mrs  Pomfret  who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes   Pray desire  continued her mistress   that he will bring up breakfast this morning  and leave the key of the house  door  Pomfret  with me  When Franklin brought the urn into the breakfast  parlour  his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand  She spoke to him of his last night  s exertions in terms of much approbation   How long have you lived with me  said she  pausing   three weeks  I think   Three weeks and four days  madam   That is but a short time  yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think I may depend upon you  You know this key   I believe  madam  it is the key of the house  door   It is  I shall trust it in your care  It is a great trust for so young a person as you are  Franklin stood silent  with a firm but modest look   If you take the charge of this key  continued his mistress   remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own hands  In the daytime it must not be left in the door  You must not tell anybody where you keep it at night  and the house  door must not be unlocked after eleven o  clock at night  unless by my orders  Will you take charge of the key upon these conditions   I will  madam  do anything you order me  said Franklin  and received the key from her hands  When Mrs  Churchill  s orders were made known  they caused many secret marvellings and murmurings  Corkscrew and Felix were disconcerted  and dared not openly avow their discontent  and they treated Franklin with the greatest seeming kindness and cordiality  Everything went on smoothly for three days  The butler never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse  but went to bed in proper time  and paid particular court to Mrs Pomfret  in order to dispel her suspicions  She had never had any idea of the real fact  that he and Felix were joined in a plot with house  breakers to rob the house  but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for drinking  Thus stood affairs the night before Mrs  Churchill  s birthday  Corkscrew  by the housekeeper  s means  ventured to present a petition that he might go to the play the next day  and his request was granted  Franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered round the butler  who  with great importance  was reading aloud the play  bill  Everybody present soon began to speak at once  and with great enthusiasm talked of the playhouse  the actors  and actresses  and then Felix  in the first pause  turned to Franklin  and said   Lord  you know nothing of all this  YOU never went to a play  did you   Never  said Franklin  and felt  he did not know why  a little ashamed  and he longed extremely to go to one   How should you like to go to the play with me to  morrow  said Corkscrew   Oh  exclaimed Franklin   I should like it exceedingly   And do you think mistress would let you if I asked   I think maybe she would  if Mrs  Pomfret asked her   But then you have no money  have you   No  said Franklin  sighing   But stay  said Corkscrew   what I am thinking of is  that if mistress will let you go  I  ll treat you myself  rather than that you should he disappointed  Delight  surprise and gratitude appeared in Franklin  s face at these words  Corkscrew rejoiced to see that now  at least  he had found a most powerful temptation   Well then  I  ll go just now and ask her  In the meantime  lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two   The key  answered Franklin  starting   I  m sorry  but I can  t do that  for I  ve promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands   But how will she know anything of the matter  Run  run  and get it for us   No  I CANNOT  replied Franklin  resisting the push which the butler gave his shoulder   You can  t  cried Corkscrew  changing his tone   then  sir  I can  t take you to the play   Very well  sir  said Franklin  sorrowfully  but with steadiness   Very well  sir  said Felix  mimicking him   you need not look so important  nor fancy yourself such a great man  because you  re master of a key   Say no more to him  interrupted Corkscrew   let him alone to take his own way  Felix  you would have no objection  I suppose  to going to the play with me   Oh  I should like it of all things  if I did not come between anybody else  But come  come  added the hypocrite  assuming a tone of friendly persuasion   you won  t be such a blockhead  Franklin  as to lose going to the play for nothing  it  s only just obstinacy  What harm can it do  to lend Mr  Corkscrew the key for five minutes  he  ll give it to you back again safe and sound   I don  t doubt THAT  answered Franklin   Then it must be all because you don  t wish to oblige Mr  Corkscrew   No  but I can  t oblige him in this  for  as I told you before  my mistress trusted me  I promised never to let the key out of my own hands  and you would not have me break my trust  Mr  Spencer told me that was worse than ROBBING  At the word ROBBING both Corkscrew and Felix involuntarily cast down their eyes  and turned the conversation immediately  saying  that he did very right  that they did not really want the key  and had only asked for it just to try if he would keep his word   Shake hands  said Corkscrew   I am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow   I am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow before  Mr  Corkscrew  said Franklin  giving his hand rather proudly  and he walked away   We shall make no hand of this prig  said Corkscrew   But we  ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy  said Felix   and let him make his story good as he can afterwards  He shall repent of these airs  To  night I  ll watch him  and find out where he hides the key  and when he  s asleep we  ll get it without thanking him  This plan Felix put into execution  They discovered the place where Franklin kept the key at night  stole it whilst he slept  took off the impression in wax  and carefully replaced it in Franklin  s trunk  exactly where they found it  Probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax  Knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it  and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant  By means of the impression  which they had thus obtained  Corkscrew and Felix proposed to get a false key made by Picklock  a smith who belonged to their gang of house  breakers  and with this false key knew they could open the door whenever they pleased  Little suspecting what had happened  Franklin  the next morning went to unlock the house door  as usual  but finding the key entangled in the lock  he took it out to examine it  and perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards  Struck with this circumstance  it brought to his mind all that had passed the preceding evening  and being sure that he had no wax near the key  he began to suspect what had happened  and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix say  that  give him but a halfpenny worth of wax  and he could open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands  All these things considered  Franklin resolved to take the key just as it was  with the wax sticking to it  to his mistress   I was not mistaken when I thought I might trust YOU with this key  said Mrs  Churchill  after she had heard his story   My brother will be here to  day  and I shall consult him  In the meantime  say nothing of what has passed  Evening came  and after tea Mr  Spencer sent for Franklin upstairs   So  Mr  Franklin  said he   I  m glad to find you are in such high TRUST in this family  Franklin bowed   But you have lost  I understand  the pleasure of going to the play to  night   I don  t think anything  much  I mean  of that  sir  answered Franklin  smiling   Are Corkscrew and Felix GONE to the play   Yes  half an hour ago  sir   Then I shall look into his room  and examine the pantry and the plate that is under his care  When Mr  Spencer came to examine the pantry  he found the large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door  and the other things placed so as to be easily carried off  Nothing at first appeared in Corkscrew  s bedchamber  to strengthen their suspicions  till  just as they were going to leave the room  Mrs  Pomfret exclaimed   Why  if there is not Mr  Corkscrew  s dress coat hanging up there  and if here isn  t Felix  s fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play  Why  sir  they can  t be gone to the play  Look at the cravat  Ah  upon my word I am afraid they are not at the play  No  sir  you may be sure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse  and they  ll certainly break into the house to  night  We shall all be murdered in our beds  as sure as I  m a living woman  sir  but if you  ll only take my advice   Pray  good Mrs  Pomfret  Mr  Spencer observed   don  t be alarmed   Nay  sir  but I won  t pretend to sleep in the house  if Franklin isn  t to have a blunderbuss  and I a BAGGONET   You shall have both  indeed  Mrs  Pomfret  but don  t make such a noise  for everybody will hear you  The love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered Mrs  Pomfret  s love of talking  She was silent  and contented herself the rest of the evening with making signs  looking ominous  and stalking about the house like one possessed with a secret  Escaped from Mrs  Pomfret  s fears and advice  Mr  Spencer went to a shop within a few doors of the alehouse  which he heard Corkscrew frequented  and sent to beg to speak to the landlord  He came  and  when Mr  Spencer questioned him  confessed that Corkscrew and Felix were actually drinking in his house with two men of suspicious appearance  that  as he passed through the passage  he heard them disputing about a key  and that one of them said   Since we  ve got the key  we  ll go about it to  night  This was sufficient information  Mr  Spencer  lest the landlord should give them information of what was going forwards  took him along with him to Bow Street  A constable and proper assistance was sent to Mrs  Churchill  s  They stationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading to the butler  s pantry  where the plate was kept  A little after midnight they heard the hall door open  Corkscrew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry  and there Mr  Spencer and the constable immediately secured them  as they were carrying off their booty  Mrs Churchill and Pomfret had spent the night at the house of an acquaintance in the same street   Well  ma  am  said Mrs  Pomfret  who had heard all the news in the morning   the villains are all safe  thank God  I was afraid to go to the window this morning  but it was my luck to see them all go by to gaol  They looked so shocking  I am sure I never shall forget Felix  s look to my dying day  But poor Franklin  ma  am  that boy has the best heart in the world  I could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed  Poor fellow  I thought he would have dropped  and he was so modest  ma  am  when Mr  Spencer spoke to him  and told him he had done his duty   And did my brother tell him what reward I intend for him   No  ma  am  and I  m sure Franklin thinks no more of REWARD than I do   I intend  continued Mrs  Churchill   to sell some of my old useless plate  and to lay it out in an annuity for Franklin  s life   La  ma  am  exclaimed Mrs  Pomfret  with unfeigned joy   I  m sure you are very good  and I  m very glad of it   And  continued Mrs  Churchill   here are some tickets for the play  which I shall beg you  Pomfret  to give him  and to take him with you   I am very much obliged to you  indeed  ma  am  and I  ll go with him with all my heart  and choose such plays as won  t do no prejudice to his morality  And  ma  am  continued Mrs  Pomfret   the night after the fire I left him my great Bible and my watch  in my will  for I never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days  but he has won me by his own DESERTS  and I shall from this time forth love all the VILLAINTROPIC folks for his sake  SIMPLE SUSAN  CHAPTER I  Waked as her custom was  before the day  To do the observance due to sprightly May  Dryden  In a retired hamlet on the borders of Wales  between Oswestry and Shrewsbury  it is still the custom to celebrate the st of May  The children of the village  who look forward to this rural festival with joyful eagerness  usually meet on the last day of April to make up their nosegays for the morning and to choose their queen  Their customary place of meeting is at a hawthorn  which stands in a little green nook  open on one side to a shady lane  and separated on the other side by a thick sweet  brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an attorney  This attorney began the world with nothing  but he contrived to scrape together a good deal of money  everybody knew how  He built a new house at the entrance of the village  and had a large  well fenced garden  yet  notwithstanding his fences  he never felt himself secure  Such were his litigious habits  and his suspicious temper  that he was constantly at variance with his simple and peaceable neighbours  Some pig  or dog  or goat  or goose was for ever trespassing  His complaints and his extortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet  The paths in his fields were at length unfrequented  his stiles were blocked up with stones or stuffed with brambles and briers  so that not a gosling could creep under  or a giant get over them  Indeed  so careful were even the village children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law  that they would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees  or fall upon his meadow  Mr  Case  for this was the name of our attorney  had a son and a daughter  to whose education he had not time to attend  as his whole soul was intent upon accumulating for them a fortune  For several years he suffered his children to run wild in the village  but suddenly  on his being appointed to a considerable agency  he began to think of making his children a little genteel  He sent his son to learn Latin  he hired a maid to wait upon his daughter Barbara  and he strictly forbade her thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children  who had hitherto been her playfellows  They were not sorry for this prohibition  because she had been their tyrant rather than their companion  She was vexed to observe that her absence was not regretted  and she was mortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of airs and finery  There was one poor girl  amongst her former associates  to whom she had a peculiar dislike  Susan Price  a sweet tempered  modest  sprightly  industrious lass  who was the pride and delight of the village  Her father rented a small farm  and  unfortunately for him  he lived near Attorney Case  Barbara used often to sit at her window  watching Susan at work  Sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds  or weeding the borders  sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees  sometimes she was in the poultry yard  scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager chickens  and in the evening she was often seated in a little honeysuckle arbour  with a clean  light  three  legged deal table before her  upon which she put her plain work  Susan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother  who was very fond of her  and to whom she was most gratefully attached  Mrs  Price was an intelligent  active  domestic woman  but her health was not robust  She earned money  however  by taking in plain work  and she was famous for baking excellent bread and breakfast cakes  She was respected in the village  for her conduct as a wife and as a mother  and all were eager to show her attention  At her door the first branch of hawthorn was always placed on May morning  and her Susan was usually Queen of the May  It was now time to choose the Queen  The setting sun shone full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn  when the merry group assembled upon their little green  Barbara was now walking in sullen state in her father  s garden  She heard the busy voices in the lane  and she concealed herself behind the high hedge  that she might listen to their conversation   Where  s Susan  were the first unwelcome words which she overheard   Ay  where  s Susan  repeated Philip  stopping short in the middle of a new tune that he was playing on his pipe   I wish Susan would come  I want her to sing me this same tune over again  I have not it yet   And I wish Susan would come  I  m sure  cried a little girl  whose lap was full of primroses   Susan will give me some thread to tie up my nosegays  and she  ll show me where the fresh violets grow  and she has promised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to  morrow  I wish she would come   Nothing can be done without Susan  She always shows us where the nicest flowers are to be found in the lanes and meadows  said they   She must make up the garlands  and she shall be Queen of the May  exclaimed a multitude of little voices   But she does not come  said Philip  Rose  who was her particular friend  now came forward to assure the impatient assembly   that she would answer for it Susan would come as soon as she possibly could  and that she probably was detained by business at home  The little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs  and Rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately   Tell her to make haste  cried Philip   Attorney Case dined at the Abbey to  day  luckily for us  If he comes home and finds us here  maybe he  ll drive us away  for he says this bit of ground belongs to his garden  though that is not true  I  m sure  for Farmer Price knows  and says  it was always open to the road  The Attorney wants to get our playground  so he does  I wish he and his daughter Bab  or Miss Barbara  as she must now be called  were a hundred miles off  out of our way  I know  No later than yesterday she threw down my nine  pins in one of her ill  humours  as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust   Yes  cried Mary  the little primrose  girl   her gown is always trailing  She does not hold it up nicely  like Susan  and with all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat  Mamma says she wishes I may be like Susan  when I grow up to be a great girl  and so do I  I should not like to look conceited as Barbara does  if I was ever so rich   Rich or poor  said Philip   it does not become a girl to look conceited  much less BOLD  as Barbara did the other day  when she was at her father  s door without a hat upon her head  staring at the strange gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink  I know what he thought of Bab by his looks  and of Susan  too  for Susan was in her garden  bending down a branch of the laburnum  tree  looking at its yellow flowers  which were just come out  and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from Shrewsbury  she answered him so modest  not bashful  like as if she had never seen nobody before  but just right  and then she pulled on her straw hat  which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum  and she went her ways home  and the gentleman says to me  after she was gone   Pray  who is that neat  modest girl  But I wish Susan would come  cried Philip  interrupting himself  Susan was all this time  as her friend Rose rightly guessed  busy at home  She was detained by her father  s returning later than usual  His supper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home  and Susan swept up the ashes twice  and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him  but at last  when he did come in  he took no notice of the blaze or of Susan  and when his wife asked him how he did  he made no answer  but stood with his back to the fire  looking very gloomy  Susan put his supper upon the table  and set his own chair for him  but he pushed away the chair and turned from the table  saying  I shall eat nothing  child  Why have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year   You said yesterday  father  I thought  that you liked a little cheerful wood fire in the evening  and there was a great shower of hail  your coat is quite wet  we must dry it   Take it  then  child  said he  pulling it off  I shall soon have no coat to dry  and take my hat  too  said he  throwing it upon the ground  Susan hung up his hat  put his coat over the back of a chair to dry  and then stood anxiously looking at her mother  who was not well  she had this day fatigued herself with baking  and now  alarmed by her husband  s moody behaviour  she sat down pale and trembling  He threw himself into a chair  folded his arms  and fixed his eyes upon the fire  Susan was the first who ventured to break silence  Happy the father who has such a daughter as Susan  her unaltered sweetness of temper  and her playful  affectionate caresses  at last somewhat dissipated her father  s melancholy  He could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been prepared for him  however  with a faint smile  he told Susan that he thought he could eat one of her guinea  hen  s eggs  She thanked him  and with that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please  she ran to her neat chicken  yard  but  alas  her guinea  hen was not there  it had strayed into the attorney  s garden  She saw it through the paling  and timidly opening the little gate  she asked Miss Barbara  who was walking slowly by  to let her come in and take her guinea  hen  Barbara  who was at this instant reflecting  with no agreeable feelings  upon the conversation of the village children  to which she had recently listened  started when she heard Susan  s voice  and with a proud  ill  humoured look and voice  refused her request   Shut the gate  said Barbara   you have no business in our garden  and as for your hen  I shall keep it  it is always flying in here  and plaguing us  and my father says it is a trespasser  and he told me I might catch it and keep it the next time it got in  and it is in now  Then Barbara called to her maid  Betty  and bid her catch the mischievous hen   Oh  my guinea  hen  my pretty guinea  hen  cried Susan  as they hunted the frightened  screaming creature from corner to corner   Here we have got it  said Betty  holding it fast by the legs   Now pay damages  Queen Susan  or good  bye to your pretty guinea  hen  said Barbara  in an insulting tone   Damages  what damages  said Susan   tell me what I must pay   A shilling  said Barbara   Oh  if sixpence would do  said Susan   I have but sixpence of my own in the world  and here it is   It won  t do  said Barbara  turning her back   Nay  but hear me  cried Susan   let me at least come in to look for its eggs  I only want ONE for my father  s supper  you shall have all the rest   What  s your father  or his supper to us  is he so nice that he can eat none but guinea  hen  s eggs  said Barbara   If you want your hen and your eggs  pay for them  and you  ll have them   I have but sixpence  and you say that won  t do  said Susan with a sigh  as she looked at her favourite  which was in the maid  s grasping hands  struggling and screaming in vain  Susan retired disconsolate  At the door of her father  s cottage she saw her friend Rose  who was just come to summon her to the hawthorn bush   They are all at the hawthorn  and I am come for you  We can do nothing without YOU  dear Susan  cried Rose  running to meet her  at the moment she saw her   You are chosen Queen of the May  come  make haste  But what is the matter  why do you look so sad   Ah  said Susan   don  t wait for me  I can  t come to you  but  added she  pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden   gather those for poor little Mary  I promised them to her  and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile  on the right as we go to church  Good  bye  never mind me  I can  t come  I can  t stay  for my father wants me   But don  t turn away your face  I won  t keep you a moment  only tell me what  s the matter  said her friend  following her into the cottage   Oh  nothing  not much  said Susan   only that I wanted the egg in a great hurry for father  it would not have vexed me  to be sure I should have clipped my guinea  hen  s wings  and then she could not have flown over the hedge  but let us think no more about it  now  added she  twinkling away a tear  When Rose  however  learnt that her friend  s guinea  hen was detained prisoner by the attorney  s daughter  she exclaimed  with all the honest warmth of indignation  and instantly ran back to tell the story to her companions   Barbara  ay  like father  like daughter  cried Farmer Price  starting from the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed  and drawing his chair closer to his wife   You see something is amiss with me  wife  I  ll tell you what it is  As he lowered his voice  Susan  who was not sure that he wished she should hear what he was going to say  retired from behind his chair   Susan  don  t go  sit you down here  my sweet Susan  said he  making room for her upon his chair   I believe I was a little cross when I came in first tonight  but I had something to vex me  as you shall hear   About a fortnight ago  you know  wife  continued he   there was a balloting in our town for the militia  now at that time I wanted but ten days of forty years of age  and the attorney told me I was a fool for not calling myself plump forty  But the truth is the truth  and it is what I think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it  So I was drawn for a militiaman  but when I thought how loth you and I would be to part  I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute  only I had not the nine guineas  for  you know  we had bad luck with our sheep this year  and they died away one after another  but that was no excuse  so I went to Attorney Case  and  with a power of difficulty  I got him to lend me the money  for which  to be sure  I gave him something  and left my lease of our farm with him  as he insisted upon it  by way of security for the loan  Attorney Case is too many for me  He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease  and the lease  he tells me  is not worth a farthing  and that he can turn us all out of our farm to  morrow if he pleases  and sure enough he will please  for I have thwarted him this day  and he swears he  ll be revenged of me  Indeed  he has begun with me badly enough already  I  m not come to the worst part of my story yet  Here Farmer Price made a dead stop  and his wife and Susan looked up in his face  breathless with anxiety   It must come out  said he  with a short sigh   I must leave you in three days  wife   Must you  said his wife  in a faint  resigned voice   Susan  love  open the window  Susan ran to open the window  and then returned to support her mother  s head  When she came a little to herself she sat up  begged that her husband would go on  and that nothing might be concealed from her  Her husband had no wish indeed to conceal anything from a wife he loved so well  but  firm as he was  and steady to his maxim  that the truth was the thing the fittest to be spoken at all times  his voice faltered  and it was with great difficulty that he brought himself to speak the whole truth at this moment  The fact was this  Case met Farmer Price as he was coming home  whistling  from a new ploughed field  The attorney had just dined at The Abbey  The Abbey was the family seat of an opulent baronet in the neighbourhood  to whom Mr  Case had been agent  The baronet died suddenly  and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother  who was now just arrived in the country  and to whom Mr  Case was eager to pay his court  in hopes of obtaining his favour  Of the agency he flattered himself that he was pretty secure  and he thought that he might assume the tone of command towards the tenants  especially towards one who was some guineas in debt  and in whose lease there was a flaw  Accosting the farmer in a haughty manner  the attorney began with   So  Farmer Price  a word with you  if you please  Walk on here  man  beside my horse  and you  ll hear me  You have changed your opinion  I hope  about that bit of land  that corner at the end of my garden   As how  Mr  Case  said the farmer   As how  man  Why  you said something about its not belonging to me  when you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day   So I did  said Price   and so I do  Provoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words were pronounced  the attorney was upon the point of swearing that he would have his revenge  but  as his passions were habitually attentive to the LETTER of the law  he refrained from any hasty expression  which might  he was aware  in a court of justice  be hereafter brought against him   My good friend  Mr  Price  said he  in a soft voice  and pale with suppressed rage  He forced a smile   I  m under the necessity of calling in the money I lent you some time ago  and you will please to take notice  that it must be paid to  morrow morning  I wish you a good evening  You have the money ready for me  I daresay   No  said the farmer   not a guinea of it  but John Simpson  who was my substitute  has not left our village yet  I  ll get the money back from him  and go myself  if so be it must be so  into the militia  so I will  The attorney did not expect such a determination  and he represented  in a friendly  hypocritical tone to Price  that he had no wish to drive him to such an extremity  that it would be the height of folly in him TO RUN HIS HEAD AGAINST A WALL FOR NO PURPOSE   You don  t mean to take the corner into your own garden  do you  Price  said he   I  said the farmer   God forbid  it  s none of mine  I never take what does not belong to me   True  right  very proper  of course  said Mr  Case   but then you have no interest in life in the land in question   None   Then why so stiff about it  Price  All I want of you to say   To say that black is white  which I won  t do  Mr  Case  The ground is a thing not worth talking of  but it  s neither yours nor mine  In my memory  since the NEW lane was made  it has always been open to the parish  and no man shall inclose it with my good  will  Truth is truth  and must be spoken  justice is justice  and should be done  Mr  Attorney   And law is law  Mr  Farmer  and shall have its course  to your cost  cried the attorney  exasperated by the dauntless spirit of this village Hampden  Here they parted  The glow of enthusiasm  the pride of virtue  which made our hero brave  could not render him insensible  As he drew nearer home  many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart  He passed the door of his own cottage with resolute steps  however  and went through the village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute  He found him  told him how the matter stood  and luckily the man  who had not yet spent the money  was willing to return it  as there were many others drawn for the militia  who  he observed  would be glad to give him the same price  or more  for his services  The moment Price got the money  he hastened to Mr  Case  s house  walked straight forward into his room  and laying the money down upon his desk   There  Mr  Attorney  are your nine guineas  count them  now I have done with you   Not yet  said the attorney  jingling the money triumphantly in his hand   We  ll give you a taste of the law  my good sir  or I  m mistaken  You forgot the flaw in your lease  which I have safe in this desk   Ah  my lease  said the farmer  who had almost forgot to ask for it till he was thus put in mind of it by the attorney  s imprudent threat   Give me my lease  Mr  Case  I  ve paid my money  you have no right to keep the lease any longer  whether it is a bad one or a good one   Pardon me  said the attorney  locking his desk  and putting the key into his pocket   possession  my honest friend  cried he  striking his hand upon the desk   is nine points of the law  Good night to you  I cannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which I know there is a capital flaw  It is my duty to show it to my employer  or  in other words  to your new landlord  whose agent I have good reasons to expect I shall be  you will live to repent your obstinacy  Mr  Price  Your servant  sir  Price retired with melancholy feelings  but not intimidated  Many a man returns home with a gloomy countenance  who has not quite so much cause for vexation  When Susan heard her father  s story  she quite forgot her guinea  hen  and her whole soul was intent upon her poor mother  who  notwithstanding her utmost exertion  could not support herself under this sudden stroke of misfortune  In the middle of the night Susan was called up  her mother  s fever ran high for some hours  but towards morning it abated  and she fell into a soft sleep with Susan  s hand locked fast in hers  Susan sat motionless  and breathed softly  lest she should disturb her  The rushlight  which stood beside the bed  was now burnt low  the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted  faded  appeared  and vanished  as the flame rose and sunk in the socket  Susan was afraid that the disagreeable smell might waken her mother  and  gently disengaging her hand  she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle  All was silent  the grey light of the morning was now spreading over every object  the sun rose slowly  and Susan stood at the lattice window  looking through the small leaded  cross  barred panes at the splendid spectacle  A few birds began to chirp  but  as Susan was listening to them  her mother started in her sleep  and spoke unintelligibly  Susan hung up a white apron before the window to keep out the light  and just then she heard the sound of music at a distance in the village  As it approached nearer  she knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and tabor  She distinguished the merry voices of her companions  carolling in honour of the May  and soon she saw them coming towards her father  s cottage  with branches and garlands in their hands  She opened quick  but gently  the latch of the door  and ran out to meet them   Here she is  here  s Susan  they exclaimed  joyfully   Here  s the Queen of the May   And here  s her crown  cried Rose  pressing forward  but Susan put her finger upon her lips  and pointed to her mother  s window  Philip  s pipe stopped instantly   Thank you  said Susan   my mother is ill  I can  t leave her  you know  Then gently putting aside the crown  her companions bid her say who should wear it for her   Will you  dear Rose  said she  placing the garland upon her friend  s head   It  s a charming May morning  added she  with a smile   good  bye  We sha  n  t hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village  so you need only stop till then  Philip   I shall stop for all day  said Philip   I  ve no mind to play any more   Good  bye  poor Susan  It is a pity you can  t come with us  said all the children  and little Mary ran after Susan to the cottage door   I forgot to thank you  said she   for the double cowslips  look how pretty they are  and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom  and kiss me quick  for I shall be left behind  Susan kissed the little breathless girl  and returned softly to the side of her mother  s bed   How grateful that child is to me  for a cowslip only  How can I be grateful enough to such a mother as this  said Susan to herself  as she bent over her sleeping mother  s pale countenance  Her mother  s unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed  and Susan sat down in her wicker arm  chair  and went on with the row  in the middle of which her hand stopped the preceding evening   She taught me to knit  she taught me everything that I know  thought Susan   and the best of all  she taught me to love her  to wish to be like her  Her mother  when she awakened  felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep  and observing that it was a delightful morning  said   that she had been dreaming she heard music  but that the drum frightened her  because she thought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole regiment of soldiers  who had pointed their bayonets at him  But that was but a dream  Susan  I awoke  and knew it was a dream  and I then fell asleep  and have slept soundly ever since  How painful it is to awake to the remembrance of misfortune  Gradually as this poor woman collected her scattered thoughts  she recalled the circumstances of the preceding evening  She was too certain that she had heard from her husband  s own lips the words   I MUST LEAVE YOU IN THREE DAYS  and she wished that she could sleep again  and think it all a dream   But he  ll want  he  ll want a hundred things  said she  starting up   I must get his linen ready for him  I  m afraid it  s very late  Susan  why did you let me lie so long   Everything shall be ready  dear mother  only don  t hurry yourself  said Susan  And indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry  or to do any work this day  Susan  s affectionate  dexterous  sensible activity was never more wanted  or more effectual  She understood so readily  she obeyed so exactly  and when she was left to her own discretion  judged so prudently  that her mother had little trouble and no anxiety in directing her  She said that Susan never did too little  or too much  Susan was mending her father  s linen  when Rose tapped softly at the window  and beckoned to her to come out  She went out   How does your mother do  in the first place  said Rose   Better  thank you   That  s well  and I have a little bit of good news for you besides  here  said she  pulling out a glove  in which there was money   we  ll get the guinea  hen back again  we have all agreed about it  This is the money that has been given to us in the village this May morning  At every door they gave silver  See how generous they have been  twelve shillings  I assure you  Now we are a match for Miss Barbara  You won  t like to leave home  I  ll go to Barbara  and you shall see your guinea  hen in ten minutes  Rose hurried away  pleased with her commission  and to accomplish her business  Miss Barbara  s maid Betty was the first person that was visible at the attorney  s house  Rose insisted upon seeing Miss Barbara herself  and she was shown into a parlour to the young lady  who was reading a dirty novel  which she put under a heap of law papers as they entered   Dear  how you STARTLED me  Is it only you  said she to her maid  but as soon as she saw Rose behind the maid  she put on a scornful air   Could not ye say I was not at home  Betty  Well  my good girl  what brings you here  Something to borrow or beg  I suppose  May every ambassador  every ambassador in as good a cause  answer with as much dignity and moderation as Rose replied to Barbara upon the present occasion  She assured her  that the person from whom she came did not send her either to beg or borrow  that she was able to pay the full value of that for which she came to ask  and  producing her well filled purse   I believe that this is a very good shilling  said she   If you don  t like it  I will change it  and now you will be so good as to give me Susan  s guinea  hen  It is in her name I ask for it   No matter in whose name you ask for it  replied Barbara   you will not have it  Take up your shilling  if you please  I would have taken a shilling yesterday  if it had been paid at the time properly  but I told Susan  that if it was not paid then  I should keep the hen  and so I shall  I promise her  You may go back  and tell her so  The attorney  s daughter had  whilst Rose opened her negotiation  measured the depth of her purse with a keen eye  and her penetration discovered that it contained at least ten shillings  With proper management she had some hopes that the guinea  hen might be made to bring in at least half the money  Rose  who was of a warm temper  not quite so fit a match as she had thought herself for the wily Barbara  incautiously exclaimed   Whatever it costs us  we are determined to have Susan  s favourite hen  so  if one shilling won  t do  take two  and if two won  t do  why  take three  The shillings sounded provoking upon the table  as she threw them down one after another  and Barbara coolly replied   Three won  t do   Have you no conscience  Miss Barbara  Then take four  Barbara shook her head  A fifth shilling was instantly proffered  but Bab  who now saw plainly that she had the game in her own hands  preserved a cold  cruel silence  Rose went on rapidly  bidding shilling after shilling  till she had completely emptied her purse  The twelve shillings were spread upon the table  Barbara  s avarice was moved  she consented for this ransom to liberate her prisoner  Rose pushed the money towards her  but just then  recollecting that she was acting for others more than for herself  and doubting whether she had full powers to conclude such an extravagant bargain  she gathered up the public treasure  and with newly  recovered prudence observed that she must go back to consult her friends  Her generous little friends were amazed at Barbara  s meanness  but with one accord declared that they were most willing  for their parts  to give up every farthing of the money  They all went to Susan in a body  and told her so   There  s our purse  said they   do what you please with it  They would not wait for one word of thanks  but ran away  leaving only Rose with her to settle the treaty for the guinea  hen  There is a certain manner of accepting a favour  which shows true generosity of mind  Many know how to give  but few know how to accept a gift properly  Susan was touched  but not astonished  by the kindness of her young friends  and she received the purse with as much simplicity as she would have given it   Well  said Rose   shall I go back for the guinea  hen   The guinea  hen  said Susan  starting from a reverie into which she had fallen  as she contemplated the purse   Certainly I DO long to see my pretty guinea  hen once more  but I was not thinking of her just then  I was thinking of my father  Now Susan had heard her mother often  in the course of this day  wish that she had but money enough in the world to pay John Simpson for going to serve in the militia instead of her husband   This  to be sure  will go but a little way  thought Susan   but still it may be of some use to my father  She told her mind to Rose  and concluded by saying  decidedly  that  if the money was given to her to dispose of as she pleased  she would give it to her father   It is all yours  my dear  good Susan  cried Rose  with a look of warm approbation   This is so like you  but I  m sorry that Miss Bab must keep your guinea  hen  I would not be her for all the guinea  hens  or guineas either  in the whole world  Why  I  ll answer for it  the guinea  hen won  t make her happy  and you  ll be happy EVEN without  because you are good  Let me come and help you to  morrow  continued she  looking at Susan  s work   if you have any more mending work to do  I never liked work till I worked with you  I won  t forget my thimble or my scissors  added she  laughing  though I used to forget them when I was a giddy girl  I assure you I am a great hand at my needle  now  try me  Susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle  and that she would most willingly accept of her services  but that UNLUCKILY she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted   But do you know  said she   I shall have a great deal of business to  morrow  but I won  t tell you what it is that I have to do  for I am afraid I shall not succeed  but if I do succeed  I  ll come and tell you directly  because you will be so glad of it  Susan  who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her  and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the family at the Abbey  had now formed the courageous  but not presumptuous idea  that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread  One of the servants from the Abbey had been sent all round the village in the morning in search of bread  and had not been able to procure any that was tolerable  Mrs  Price  s last baking failed for want of good barm  She was not now strong enough to attempt another herself  and when the brewer  s boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast  she thanked him  but sighed  and said it would be of no use to her  Accordingly she went to work with much prudent care  and when her bread the next morning came out of the oven  it was excellent  at least her mother said so  and she was a good judge  It was sent to the Abbey  and as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival in the country  they also were earnest and warm in its praise  Inquiries were made from the housekeeper  and they heard  with some surprise  that this excellent bread was made by a young girl only twelve years old  The housekeeper  who had known Susan from a child  was pleased to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour   She is the most industrious little creature  ma  am  in the world  said she to her mistress   Little I can  t so well call her now  since she  s grown tall and slender to look at  and glad I am she is grown up likely to look at  for handsome is that handsome does  she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself  yet she has as proper a respect for herself  ma  am  as you have  and I always see her neat  and with her mother  ma  am  or fit people  as a girl should be  As for her mother  she dotes upon her  as well she may  for I should myself if I had half such a daughter  and then she has two little brothers  and she  s as good to them  and  my boy Philip says  taught  em to read more than the school  mistress  all with tenderness and good nature  but  I beg your pardon  ma  am  I cannot stop myself when I once begin to talk of Susan   You have really said enough to excite my curiosity  said her mistress   pray send for her immediately  we can see her before we go out to walk  The benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy Philip for Susan  who never happened to be in such an UNTIDY state as to be unable to obey a summons without a long preparation  She had  it is true  been very busy  but orderly people can be busy and neat at the same time  She put on her usual straw hat  and accompanied Rose  s mother  who was going with a basket of cleared muslin to the Abbey  The modest simplicity of Susan  s appearance and the artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her  pleased the ladies at the Abbey  who were good judges of character and manners  Sir Arthur Somers had two sisters  sensible  benevolent women  They were not of that race of fine ladies who are miserable the moment they come to THE COUNTRY  nor yet were they of that bustling sort  who quack and direct all their poor neighbours  for the mere love of managing  or the want of something to do  They were judiciously generous  and whilst they wished to diffuse happiness  they were not peremptory in requiring that people should be happy precisely their own way  With these dispositions  and with a well informed brother  who  though he never wished to direct  was always willing to assist in their efforts to do good  there were reasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the poor villagers amongst whom they were now settled  As soon as Miss Somers had spoken to Susan  she inquired for her brother  but Sir Arthur was in his study  and a gentleman was with him on business  Susan was desirous of returning to her mother  and the ladies therefore would not detain her  Miss Somers told her  with a smile  when she took leave  that she would call upon her in the evening at six o  clock  It was impossible that such a grand event as Susan  s visit to the Abbey could long remain unknown to Barbara Case and her gossiping maid  They watched eagerly for the moment of her return  that they might satisfy their curiosity   There she is  I declare  just come into her garden  cried Bab   I  ll run in and get it all out of her in a minute  Bab could descend  without shame  whenever it suited her purposes  from the height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning familiarity  Susan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mother  s broth   So  Susan  said Bab  who came close up to her before she perceived it   how goes the world with you to  day   My mother is rather better to  day  she says  ma  am  thank you  replies Susan  coldly but civilly   MA  AM  dear  how polite we are grown of a sudden  cried Bab  winking at her maid   One may see you  ve been in good company this morning  hey  Susan  Come  let  s hear about it   Did you see the ladies themselves  or was it only the housekeeper sent for you  said the maid   What room did you go into  continued Bab   Did you see Miss Somers  or Sir Arthur   Miss Somers   La  she saw Miss Somers  Betty  I must hear about it  Can  t you stop gathering those things for a minute  and chat a bit with us  Susan   I can  t stay  indeed  Miss Barbara  for my mother  s broth is just wanted  and I  m in a hurry  Susan ran home   Lord  her head is full of broth now  said Bab to her maid   and she has not a word for herself  though she has been abroad  My papa may well call her Simple Susan  for simple she is  and simple she will be  all the world over  For my part  I think she  s little better than a downright simpleton  But  however  simple or not  I  ll get what I want out of her  She  ll be able to speak  maybe  when she has settled the grand matter of the broth  I  ll step in and ask to see her mother  that will put her in a good humour in a trice  Barbara followed Susan into the cottage  and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth   Is it ready  said Bab  peeping into the pot that was over the fire   Dear  how savoury it smells  I  ll wait till you go in with it to your mother  for I must ask her how she does myself   Will you please to sit down then  miss  said Simple Susan  with a smile  for at this instant she forgot the guinea  hen   I have but just put the parsley into the broth  but it soon will be ready  During this interval Bab employed herself  much to her own satisfaction  in cross  questioning Susan  She was rather provoked indeed that she could not learn exactly how each of the ladies was dressed  and what there was to be for dinner at the Abbey  and she was curious beyond measure to find out what Miss Somers meant  by saying that she would call at Mr  Price  s cottage at six o  clock in the evening   What do you think she could mean   I thought she meant what she said  replied Susan   that she would come here at six o  clock   Ay  that  s as plain as a pike  staff  said Barbara   but what else did she mean  think you  People  you know  don  t always mean exactly  downright  neither more nor less than what they say   Not always  said Susan  with an arch smile  which convinced Barbara that she was not quite a simpleton   NOT ALWAYS  repeated Barbara colouring  oh  then I suppose you have some guess at what Miss Somers meant   No  said Susan   I was not thinking about Miss Somers  when I said not always   How nice that broth does look  resumed Barbara  after a pause  Susan had now poured the broth into a basin  and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds  it looked very tempting  She tasted it  and added now a little salt  and now a little more  till she thought it was just to her mother  s taste   Oh  _I_ must taste it  said Bab  taking the basin up greedily   Won  t you take a spoon  said Susan  trembling at the large mouthfuls which Barbara sucked up with a terrible noise   Take a spoonful  indeed  exclaimed Barbara  setting down the basin in high anger   The next time I taste your broth you shall affront me  if you dare  The next time I set my foot in this house  you shall be as saucy to me as you please  And she flounced out of the house  repeating  TAKE A SPOON  PIG  was what you meant to say  Susan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech  but the concluding words explained to her the mystery  Some years before this time  when Susan was a very little girl  and could scarcely speak plain  as she was eating a basin of bread and milk for her supper at the cottage door  a great pig came up  and put his nose into the basin  Susan was willing that the pig should have some share of the bread and milk  but as she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth  she presently discovered that he was likely to have more than his share  and in a simple tone of expostulation she said to him   Take a POON  pig  The saying become proverbial in the village  Susan  s little companions repeated it  and applied it upon many occasions  whenever anyone claimed more than his share of anything good  Barbara  who was then not Miss Barbara  but plain Bab  and who had played with all the poor children in the neighbourhood  was often reproved in her unjust methods of division by Susan  s proverb  Susan  as she grew up  forgot the childish saying  but the remembrance of it rankled in Barbara  s mind  and it was to this that she suspected Susan had alluded  when she recommended a spoon to her  whilst she was swallowing the basin of broth   This is a true anecdote   La  miss  said Barbara  s maid  when she found her mistress in a passion upon her return from Susan  s   I only wondered you did her the honour to set your foot within her doors  What need have you to trouble her for news about the Abbey folks  when your own papa has been there all the morning  and is just come in  and can tell you everything  Barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the Abbey that morning  for Attorney Case was mysterious even to his own family about his morning rides  He never chose to be asked where he was going  or where he had been  and this made his servants more than commonly inquisitive to trace him  Barbara  against whose apparent childishness and real cunning he was not sufficiently on his guard  had often the art of drawing him into conversation about his visits  She ran into her father  s parlour  but she knew  the moment she saw his face  that it was no time to ask questions  his pen was across his mouth  and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his contracted forehead  The wig was always pushed crooked whenever he was in a brown or rather  a black study  Barbara  who did not  like Susan  bear with her father  s testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition  but who always humoured him from artifice  tried all her skill to fathom his thoughts  and when she found that it would not do  she went to tell her maid so  and to complain that her father was so cross there was no bearing him  It is true that Attorney Case was not in the happiest mood possible  for he was by no means satisfied with his morning  s work at the Abbey  Sir Arthur Somers  the NEW MAN  did not suit him  and he began to be rather apprehensive that he should not suit Sir Arthur  He had sound reasons for his doubts  Sir Arthur Somers was an excellent lawyer  and a perfectly honest man  This seemed to our attorney a contradiction in terms  in the course of his practice the case had not occurred  and he had no precedents ready to direct his proceedings  Sir Arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence  yet of plain dealing and humanity  The attorney could not persuade himself to believe that his benevolence was anything but enlightened cunning  and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded as the masterpiece of art  and the next despised as the characteristic of folly  In short  he had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave  He had settled accounts with him for his late agency  and had talked about sundry matters of business  He constantly perceived  however  that he could not impose upon Sir Arthur  but the idea that he could know all the mazes of the law  and yet prefer the straight road  was incomprehensible  Mr  Case  having paid Sir Arthur some compliments on his great legal abilities  and his high reputation at the bar  he coolly replied   I have left the bar  The attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment  that a man who was actually making   OOO pounds per annum at the bar should leave it   I am come  said Sir Arthur   to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the country which I prefer to all others  and amongst people whose happiness I hope to increase  At this speech the attorney changed his ground  flattering himself that he should find his man averse to business  and ignorant of country affairs  He talked of the value of land  and of new leases  Sir Arthur wished to enlarge his domain  and to make a ride round it  A map of it was lying upon the table  and Farmer Price  s garden came exactly across the new road for the ride  Sir Arthur looked disappointed  and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that  Price  s whole land was at his disposal   At my disposal  how so  cried Sir Arthur  eagerly   it will not be out of lease  I believe  these ten years  I  ll look into the rent roll again  perhaps I am mistaken   You are mistaken  my good sir  and you are not mistaken  said Mr  Case  with a shrewd smile   In one sense  the land will not be out of lease these ten years  and in another it is out of lease at this present time  To come to the point at once  the lease is  ab origine  null and void  I have detected a capital flaw in the body of it  I pledge my credit upon it  sir  it can  t stand a single term in law or equity  The attorney observed  that at these words Sir Arthur  s eye was fixed with a look of earnest attention   Now I have him  said the cunning tempter to himself   Neither in law nor equity  repeated Sir Arthur  with apparent incredulity   Are you sure of that  Mr  Case   Sure  As I told you before  sir  I  d pledge my whole credit upon the thing  I  d stake my existence   THAT  S SOMETHING  said Sir Arthur  as if he was pondering upon the matter  The attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man  who sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend  and of ruining a poor enemy  He explained  with legal volubility and technical amplification  the nature of the mistake in Mr  Price  s lease   It was  sir  said he   a lease for the life of Peter Price  Susanna his wife  and to the survivor or survivors of them  or for the full time and term of twenty years  to be computed from the first day of May then next ensuing  Now  sir  this  you see  is a lease in reversion  which the late Sir Benjamin Somers had not  by his settlement  a right to make  This is a curious mistake  you see  Sir Arthur  and in filling up those printed leases there  s always a good chance of some flaw  I find it perpetually  but I never found a better than this in the whole course of my practice  Sir Arthur stood in silence   My dear sir  said the attorney  taking him by the button   you have no scruple of stirring in this business   A little  said Sir Arthur   Why  then  that can be done away in a moment  Your name shall not appear in it at all  You have nothing to do but to make over the lease to me  I make all safe to you with my bond  Now  being in possession  I come forward in my own proper person  SHALL I PROCEED   No  you have said enough  replied Sir Arthur   The case  indeed  lies in a nutshell  said the attorney  who had by this time worked himself up to such a pitch of professional enthusiasm  that  intent upon his vision of a lawsuit  he totally forgot to observe the impression his words made upon Sir Arthur   There  s only one thing we have forgotten all this time  said Sir Arthur   What can that be  sir   That we shall ruin this poor man  Case was thunderstruck at these words  or rather  by the look which accompanied them  He recollected that he had laid himself open before he was sure of Sir Arthur  s REAL character  He softened  and said he should have had certainly more CONSIDERATION in the case of any but a litigious  pig  headed fellow  as he knew Price to be   If he be litigious  said Sir Arthur   I shall certainly be glad to get him fairly out of the parish as soon as possible  When you go home  you will be so good  sir  as to send me his lease  that I may satisfy myself before we stir in this business  The attorney  brightening up  prepared to take leave  but he could not persuade himself to take his departure without making one push at Sir Arthur about the agency   I will not trouble you  Sir Arthur  with this lease of Price  s  said Case   I  ll leave it with your agent  Whom shall I apply to   TO MYSELF  sir  if you please  replied Sir Arthur  The courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked more astounded than our attorney  when they received from their monarch a similar answer  It was this unexpected reply of Sir Arthur  s which had deranged the temper of Mr  Case  and caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead  and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter Barbara  After having walked up and down his room  conversing with himself  for some time  the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to somebody when Sir Arthur should have to attend his duty in Parliament  that the agency  even for the winter season  was not a thing to be neglected  and that  if he managed well  he might yet secure it for himself  He had often found that small timely presents worked wonderfully upon his own mind  and he judged of others by himself  The tenants had been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him continual petty offerings  and he resolved to try the same course with Sir Arthur  whose resolution to be his own agent  he thought  argued a close  saving  avaricious disposition  He had heard the housekeeper at the Abbey inquiring  as he passed through the servants  whether there was any lamb to be gotten  She said that Sir Arthur was remarkably fond of lamb  and that she wished she could get a quarter for him  Immediately he sallied into his kitchen  as soon as the idea struck him  and asked a shepherd  who was waiting there  whether he knew of a nice fat lamb to be had anywhere in the neighbourhood   I know of one  cried Barbara   Susan Price has a pet lamb that  s as fat as fat could be  The attorney easily caught at these words  and speedily devised a scheme for obtaining Susan  s lamb for nothing  It would be something strange if an attorney of his talents and standing was not an over  match for Simple Susan  He prowled forth in search of his prey  He found Susan packing up her father  s little wardrobe  and when she looked up as she knelt  he saw that she had been in tears   How is your mother to  day  Susan  inquired the attorney   Worse  sir  My father goes to  morrow   That  s a pity   It can  t be helped  said Susan  with a sigh   It can  t be helped  how do you know that  said Case   Sir  DEAR sir  cried she  looking up at him  and a sudden ray of hope beamed in her ingenuous countenance   And if YOU could help it  Susan  said he  Susan clasped her hands in silence  more expressive than words   You CAN help it  Susan  She started up in an ecstasy   What would you give now to have your father at home for a whole week longer   Anything  but I have nothing   Yes  but you have  a lamb  said the hard  hearted attorney   My poor little lamb  said Susan   but what can that do   What good can any lamb do  Is not lamb good to eat  Why do you look so pale  girl  Are not sheep killed every day  and don  t you eat mutton  Is your lamb better than anybody else  s  think you   I don  t know  said Susan   but I love it better   More fool you  said he   It feeds out of hand  it follows me about  I have always taken care of it  my mother gave it to me   Well  say no more about it  then  he cynically observed   if you love your lamb better than both your father and your mother  keep it  and good morning to you   Stay  oh stay  cried Susan  catching the skirt of his coat with an eager  trembling hand  a whole week  did you say  My mother may get better in that time  No  I do not love my lamb half so well  The struggle of her mind ceased  and with a placid countenance and calm voice   take the lamb  said she   Where is it  said the attorney   Grazing in the meadow  by the river side   It must be brought up before night  fall for the butcher  remember   I shall not forget it  said Susan  steadily  As soon  however  as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the house  Susan sat down  and hid her face in her hands  She was soon aroused by the sound of her mother  s feeble voice  who was calling Susan from the inner room where she lay  Susan went in  but did not undraw the curtain as she stood beside the bed   Are you there  love  Undraw the curtain  that I may see you  and tell me  I thought I heard some strange voice just now talking to my child  Something  s amiss  Susan  said her mother  raising herself as well as she was able in the bed  to examine her daughter  s countenance   Would you think it amiss  then  my dear mother  said Susan  stooping to kiss her  would you think it amiss  if my father was to stay with us a week longer   Susan  you don  t say so   He is  indeed  a whole week  but how burning hot your hand is still   Are you sure he will stay  inquired her mother   How do you know  Who told you so  Tell me all quick   Attorney Case told me so  he can get him a week  s longer leave of absence  and he has promised he will   God bless him for it  for ever and ever  said the poor woman  joining her hands   May the blessing of heaven be with him  Susan closed the curtains  and was silent  She COULD NOT SAY AMEN  She was called out of the room at this moment  for a messenger was come from the Abbey for the bread  bills  It was she who always made out the bills  for though she had not a great number of lessons from the writing  master  she had taken so much pains to learn that she could write a very neat  legible hand  and she found this very useful  She was not  to be sure  particularly inclined to draw out a long bill at this instant  but business must be done  She set to work  ruled her lines for the pounds  shillings and pence  made out the bill for the Abbey  and despatched the impatient messenger  She then resolved to make out all the bills for the neighbours  who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her baking   I had better get all my business finished  said she to herself   before I go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor lamb  This was sooner said than done  for she found that she had a great number of bills to write  and the slate on which she had entered the account was not immediately to be found  and when it was found the figures were almost rubbed out  Barbara had sat down upon it  Susan pored over the number of loaves  and the names of the persons who took them  and she wrote and cast up sums  and corrected and re  corrected them  till her head grew quite puzzled  The table was covered with little square bits of paper  on which she had been writing bills over and over again  when her father came in with a bill in his hand   How  s this  Susan  said he   How can ye be so careless  child  What is your head running upon  Here  look at the bill you were sending up to the Abbey  I met the messenger  and luckily asked to see how much it was  Look at it  Susan looked and blushed  it was written   Sir Arthur Somers  to John Price  debtor  six dozen LAMBS  so much  She altered it  and returned it to her father  but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon the table   What are all these  child   Some of them are wrong  and I  ve written them out again  said Susan   Some of them  All of them  I think  seem to be wrong  if I can read  said her father  rather angrily  and he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes  Her head  indeed  had been running upon her poor lamb  She corrected all the mistakes with so much patience  and bore to be blamed with so much good humour  that her father at last said  that it was impossible ever to scold Susan  without being in the wrong at the last  As soon as all was set right  Price took the bills  and said he would go round to the neighbours  and collect the money himself  for that he should be very proud to have it to say to them  that it was all earned by his own little daughter  Susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his week  s reprieve till he should come home to sup  as he had promised to do  in her mother  s room  She was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack  which she had been packing up for his journey   How delighted he will be when he hears the good news  said she  to herself   but I know he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb  As Susan had now settled all her business  she thought she could have time to go down to the meadow by the river side to see her favourite  but just as she had tied on her straw hat the village clock struck four  and this was the hour at which she always went to fetch her little brothers home from a dame  school near the village  She knew that they would be disappointed  if she was later than usual  and she did not like to keep them waiting  because they were very patient  good boys  so she put off the visit to her lamb  and went immediately for her brothers  CHAPTER II  Ev  n in the spring and playtime of the year  That calls th  unwonted villager abroad  With all her little ones  a sportive train  To gather king  cups in the yellow mead  And prink their heads with daisies  Cowper  The dame  school  which was about a mile from the hamlet  was not a showy edifice  but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village scholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land  it was a low roofed  long  thatched tenement  sheltered by a few reverend oaks  under which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their turn  The close shaven green  which sloped down from the hatch  door of the schoolroom  was paled round with a rude paling  which  though decayed in some parts by time  was not in any place broken by violence  The place bespoke order and peace  The dame who governed was well obeyed  because she was just and well beloved  and because she was ever glad to give well earned praise and pleasure to her little subjects  Susan had once been under her gentle dominion  and had been deservedly her favourite scholar  The dame often cited her as the best example to the succeeding tribe of emulous youngsters  She had scarcely opened the wicket which separated the green before the schoolroom door from the lane  when she heard the merry voices of the children  and saw the little troup issuing from the hatchway  and spreading over the green   Oh  there  s Susan  cried her two little brothers  running  leaping  and bounding up to her  and many of the other rosy girls and boys crowded round her  to talk of their plays  for Susan was easily interested in all that made others happy  but she could not make them comprehend  that  if they all spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was said  The voices were still raised one above another  all eager to establish some important observation about ninepins  or marbles  or tops  or bows and arrows  when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced  The music seemed to be near the spot where the children were standing  and they looked round to see whence it could come  Susan pointed to the great oak  tree  and they beheld  seated under its shade  an old man playing upon his harp  The children all approached  at first timidly  for the sounds were solemn  but as the harper heard their little footsteps coming towards him  he changed his hand and played one of his most lively tunes  The circle closed  and pressed nearer and nearer to him  some who were in the foremost row whispered to each other   He is blind   What a pity  and  He looks very poor  what a ragged coat he wears  said others   He must be very old  for all his hair is white  and he must have travelled a great way  for his shoes are quite worn out  observed another  All these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp  for when he once more began to play  not a word was uttered  He seemed pleased by their simple exclamations of wonder and delight  and  eager to amuse his young audience  he played now a gay and now a pathetic air  to suit their several humours  Susan  s voice  which was soft and sweet  expressive of gentleness and good nature  caught his ear the moment she spoke  He turned his face eagerly to the place where she stood  and it was observed  that whenever she said that she liked any tune particularly he played it over again   I am blind  said the old man   and cannot see your faces  but I know you all asunder by your voices  and I can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your voices   Can you so  indeed  cried Susan  s little brother William  who had stationed himself between the old man  s knees   Then you heard MY sister Susan speak just now  Can you tell us what sort of person she is   That I can  I think  without being a conjurer  said the old man  lifting the boy up on his knee   YOUR sister Susan is good  natured  The boy clapped his hands   And good  tempered   RIGHT  said little William  with a louder clap of applause   And very fond of the little boy who sits upon my knee   O right  right  quite right  exclaimed the child  and  quite right  echoed on all sides   But how came you to know so much  when you are blind  said William  examining the old man attentively   Hush  said John  who was a year older than his brother  and very sage   you should not put him in mind of his being blind   Though I am blind  said the harper   I can hear  you know  and I heard from your sister herself all that I told you of her  that she was good  tempered and good  natured and fond of you   Oh  that  s wrong  you did not hear all that from herself  I  m sure  said John   for nobody ever hears her praising herself   Did not I hear her tell you  said the harper   when you first came round me  that she was in a great hurry to go home  but that she would stay a little while  since you wished it so much  Was not that good  natured  And when you said you did not like the tune she liked best  she was not angry with you  but said   Then play William  s first  if you please  was not that good  tempered   Oh  interrupted William   it  s all true  but how did you find out that she was fond of me   That is such a difficult question  said the harper   that I must take time to consider  The harper tuned his instrument  as he pondered  or seemed to ponder  and at this instant  two boys who had been searching for birds  nests in the hedges  and who had heard the sound of the harp  came blustering up  and pushing their way through the circle  one of them exclaimed   What  s going on here  Who are you  my old fellow  A blind harper  Well  play us a tune  if you can play ever a good one  play me  let  s see  what shall he play  Bob  added he turning to his companion   Bumper Squire Jones  The old man  though he did not seem quite pleased with the peremptory manner of the request  played  as he was desired   Bumper Squire Jones  and several other tunes were afterwards bespoke by the same rough and tyrannical voice  The little children shrunk back in timid silence  and eyed the brutal boy with dislike  This boy was the son of Attorney Case  and as his father had neglected to correct his temper when he was a child  as he grew up it became insufferable  All who were younger and weaker than himself  dreaded his approach  and detested him as a tyrant  When the old harper was so tired that he could play no more  a lad  who usually carried his harp for him  and who was within call  came up  and held his master  s hat to the company  saying   Will you be pleased to remember us  The children readily produced their halfpence  and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor  good  natured man  who had taken so much pains to entertain them  better even than upon the gingerbread woman  whose stall they loved to frequent  The hat was held some time to the attorney  s son before he chose to see it  At last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling  There were sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat   I  ll take these halfpence  said he   and here  s a shilling for you   God bless you  sir  said the lad  but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN  S HAND  he saw that it was not worth one farthing   I am afraid it is not good  sir  said the lad  whose business it was to examine the money for his master   I am afraid  then  you  ll get no other  said young Case  with an insulting laugh   It never will do  sir  persisted the lad   look at it yourself  the edges are all yellow  you can see the copper through it quite plain  Sir  nobody will take it from us   That  s your affair  said the brutal boy  pushing away his hand   You may pass it  you know  as well as I do  if you look sharp  You have taken it from me  and I shan  t take it back again  I promise you  A whisper of  that  s very unjust  was heard  The little assembly  though under evident constraint  could no longer suppress their indignation   Who says it  s unjust  cried the tyrant  sternly  looking down upon his judges  Susan  s little brothers had held her gown fast  to prevent her from moving at the beginning of this contest  and she was now so much interested to see the end of it  that she stood still  without making any resistance   Is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of silver  said the old man   Yes  here  s the butcher  s boy  said the attorney  s son   show it to him  He was a sickly  looking boy  and of a remarkably peaceful disposition  Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment against him  However  after some moments  hesitation  and after turning the shilling round several times  he pronounced   that  as far as his judgment went  but he did not pretend to be a downright CERTAIN SURE of it  the shilling was not over and above good  Then to Susan  to screen himself from manifest danger  for the attorney  s son looked upon him with a vengeful mien   But here  s Susan here  who understands silver a great deal better than I do  she takes a power of it for bread  you know   I  ll leave it to her  said the old harper   if she says the shilling is good  keep it  Jack  The shilling was handed to Susan  who  though she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference  did not hesitate  when she was called upon  to speak the truth   I think that this shilling is a bad one  said she  and the gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words  for a moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy   There  s another  then  cried he   I have sixpences and shillings too in plenty  thank my stars  Susan now walked away with her two little brothers  and all the other children separated to go to their several homes  The old harper called to Susan  and begged  that  if she was going towards the village  she would be so kind as to show him the way  His lad took up his harp  and little William took the old man by the hand   I  ll lead him  I can lead him  said he  and John ran on before them  to gather king  cups in the meadow  There was a small rivulet  which they had to cross  and as a plank which served for a bridge over it was rather narrow  Susan was afraid to trust the old blind man to his little conductor  she therefore went on the tottering plank first herself  and then led the old harper carefully over  They were now come to a gate  which opened upon the high road to the village   There is the high road straight before you  said Susan to the lad  who was carrying his master  s harp   you can  t miss it  Now I must bid you a good evening  for I  m in a great hurry to get home  and must go the short way across the fields here  which would not be so pleasant for you  because of the stiles  Good  bye  The old harper thanked her  and went along the high road  whilst she and her brothers tripped on as fast as they could by the short way across the fields   Miss Somers  I am afraid  will be waiting for us  said Susan   You know she said she would call at six  and by the length of our shadows I  m sure it is late  When they came to their own cottage  door  they heard many voices  and they saw  when they entered  several ladies standing in the kitchen   Come in  Susan  we thought you had quite forsaken us  said Miss Somers to Susan  who advanced timidly   I fancy you forgot that we promised to pay you a visit this evening  but you need not blush so much about the matter  there is no great harm done  we have only been here about five minutes  and we have been well employed in admiring your neat garden  and your orderly shelves  Is it you  Susan  who keeps these things in such nice order  continued Miss Somers  looking round the kitchen  Before Susan could reply  little William pushed forward  and answered   Yes  ma  am  it is MY sister Susan that keeps everything neat  and she always comes to school for us  too  which was what caused her to be so late   Because as how  continued John   she was loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp  It was we kept her  and we hopes  ma  am  as you ARE  as you SEEM so good  you won  t take it amiss  Miss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with which Susan  s little brothers undertook her defence  and they were  from this slight circumstance  disposed to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well united  They took Susan along with them through the village  Many neighbours came to their doors  and far from envying  they all secretly wished Susan well as she passed   I fancy we shall find what we want here  said Miss Somers  stopping before a shop  where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened in the window  and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged in tempting order  She went in  and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of the counter well  furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs  and gay  neat printed linens and calicoes   Now  Susan  choose yourself a gown  said Miss Somers   you set an example of industry and good conduct  of which we wish to take public notice  for the benefit of others  The shopkeeper  who was father to Susan  s friend Rose  looked much satisfied by this speech  and as if a compliment had been paid to himself  bowed low to Miss Somers  and then with alertness  which a London linen  draper might have admired  produced piece after piece of his best goods to his young customer  unrolled  unfolded  held the bright stuffs and calendered calicoes in various lights  Now stretched his arm to the highest shelves  and brought down in a trice what seemed to be beyond the reach of any but a giant  s arm  now dived into some hidden recess beneath the counter  and brought to light fresh beauties and fresh temptations  Susan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators  She was thinking much of her lamb  and more of her father  Miss Somers had put a bright guinea into her hand  and had bid her pay for her own gown  but Susan  as she looked at the guinea  thought it was a great deal of money to lay out upon herself  and she wished  but did know like to ask  that she might keep it for a better purpose  Some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings  and incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty  Miss Somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class   She does not like any of these things  whispered Miss Somers to her sister  Her sister observed  that Susan looked as if her thoughts were far distant from gowns   If you don  t fancy any of these  said the civil shopkeeper to Susan   we shall have a new assortment of calicoes for the spring season  soon from town   Oh  interrupted Susan  with a smile and a blush   these are all pretty  and too good for me  but   BUT what  Susan  said Miss Somers   Tell us what is passing in your little mind  Susan hesitated   Well then  we will not press you  you are scarcely acquainted with us yet  when you are  you will not be afraid  I hope  to speak your mind  Put this shining yellow counter  continued she  pointing to the guinea   in your pocket  and make what use of it you please  From what we know  and from what we have heard of you  we are persuaded that you will make a good use of it   I think  madam  said the master of the shop  with a shrewd  good natured look   I could give a pretty good guess myself what will become of that guinea  but I say nothing   No  that is right  said Miss Somers   we leave Susan entirely at liberty  and now we will not detain her any longer  Good night  Susan  we shall soon come again to your neat cottage  Susan curtsied  with an expressive look of gratitude  and with a modest frankness in her countenance  which seemed to say   I would tell you  and welcome  what I want to do with the guinea  but I am not used to speak before so many people  When you come to our cottage again you shall know all  When Susan had departed  Miss Somers turned to the obliging shopkeeper  who was folding up all the things he had opened   You have had a great deal of trouble with us  sir  said she   and since Susan will not choose a gown for herself  I must  She selected the prettiest  and whilst the man was rolling it in paper  she asked him several questions about Susan and her family  which he was delighted to answer  because he had now all opportunity of saying as much as he wished in her praise   No later back  ma  am  than last May morning  said he   as my daughter Rose was telling us  Susan did a turn  in her quiet way  by her mother  that would not displease you if you were to hear it  She was to have been Queen of the May  which in our little village  amongst the younger tribe  is a thing that is thought of a good deal  but Susan  s mother was ill  and Susan  after sitting up with her all night  would not leave her in the morning  even when they brought the crown to her  She put the crown upon my daughter Rose  s head with her own hands  and  to be sure  Rose loves her as well as if she was her own sister  But I don  t speak from partiality  for I am no relation whatever to the Prices  only a well  wisher  as everyone  I believe  who knows them is  I  ll send the parcel up to the Abbey  shall I  ma  am   If you please  said Miss Somers   and  as soon as you receive your new things from town  let us know  You will  I hope  find us good customers and well  wishers  added she  with a smile   for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well  wishers themselves  A few words may encourage the benevolent passions  and may dispose people to live in peace and happiness  a few words may set them at variance  and may lead to misery and lawsuits  Attorney Case and Miss Somers were both equally convinced of this  and their practice was uniformly consistent with their principles  But now to return to Susan  She put the bright guinea carefully into the glove with the twelve shillings  which she had received from her companions on May day  Besides this treasure  she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings  and as her father was now sure of a week  s reprieve  she had great hopes that  by some means or other  it would be possible to make up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute   If that could but be done  said she to herself   how happy would my mother be  She would be quite stout again  for she certainly is a great deal better  since I told her that father would stay a week longer  Ah  but she would not have blessed Attorney Case  though  if she had known about my poor Daisy  Susan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside  resolved to go by herself  and take leave of her innocent favourite  But she did not pass by unperceived  Her little brothers were watching for her return  and  as soon as they saw her  they ran after her  and overtook her as she reached the meadow   What did that good lady want with you  cried William  but  looking up in his sister  s face  he saw tears in her eyes  and he was silent  and walked on quietly  Susan saw her lamb by the water  side   Who are those two men  said William   What are they going to do with DAISY  The two men were Attorney Case and the butcher  The butcher was feeling whether the lamb was fat  Susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow  her little brothers ran up to the butcher  and demanded whether he was going to DO ANY HARM to the lamb  The butcher did not answer  but the attorney replied   It is not your sister  s lamb any longer  it  s mine  mine to all intents and purposes   Yours  cried the children  with terror   and will you kill it   That  s the butcher  s business  The little boys now burst into piercing lamentations  They pushed away the butcher  s hand  they threw their arms round the neck of the lamb  they kissed its forehead  it bleated   It will not bleat to  morrow  said William  and he wept bitterly  The butcher looked aside  and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron  The attorney stood unmoved  he pulled up the head of the lamb  which had just stooped to crop a mouthful of clover   I have no time to waste  said he   butcher  you  ll account with me  If it  s fat  the sooner the better  I  ve no more to say  And he walked off  deaf to the prayers of the poor children  As soon as the attorney was out of sight  Susan rose from the bank where she was seated  came up to her lamb  and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil  to let it eat out of her hand for the last time  Poor Daisy licked her well known hand   Now  let us go  said Susan   I  ll wait as long as you please  said the butcher  Susan thanked him  but walked away quickly  without looking again at her lamb  Her little brothers begged the man to stay a few minutes  for they had gathered a handful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot  and they were decking the poor animal  As it followed the boys through the village  the children collected as they passed  and the butcher  s own son was amongst the number  Susan  s steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this boy  s memory  it had saved him a beating  He went directly to his father to beg the life of Susan  s lamb   I was thinking about it  boy  myself  said the butcher   it  s a sin to kill a PET LAMB  I  m thinking  any way  it  s what I  m not used to  and don  t fancy doing  and I  ll go and say as much to Attorney Case  but he  s a hard man  there  s but one way to deal with him  and that  s the way I must take  though so be I shall be the loser thereby  but we  ll say nothing to the boys  for fear it might be the thing would not take  and then it would be worse again to poor Susan  who is a good girl  and always was  as well as she may  being of a good breed  and well reared from the first   Come  lads  don  t keep a crowd and a scandal about my door  continued he  aloud  to the children   turn the lamb in here  John  in the paddock  for to  night  and go your ways home  The crowd dispersed  but murmured  and the butcher went to the attorney   Seeing that all you want is a good  fat  tender lamb  for a present for Sir Arthur  as you told me  said the butcher   I could let you have what  s as good or better for your purpose   Better  if it  s better  I  m ready to hear reason  The butcher had choice  tender lamb  he said  fit to eat the next day  and as Mr  Case was impatient to make his offering to Sir Arthur  he accepted the butcher  s proposal  though with such seeming reluctance  that he actually squeezed out of him  before he would complete the bargain  a bribe of a fine sweetbread  In the meantime Susan  s brothers ran home to tell her that her lamb was put into the paddock for the night  this was all they knew  and even this was some comfort to her  Rose  her good friend  was with her  and she had before her the pleasure of telling her father of his week  s reprieve  Her mother was better  and even said she was determined to sit up to supper in her wicker armchair  Susan was getting this ready for supper  when little William  who was standing at the house door  watching in the dusk for his father  s return  suddenly exclaimed   Susan  if here is not our old man   Yes  said the old harper   I have found my way to you  The neighbours were kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived  for  though I didn  t know your name  they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all  Susan came to the door  and the old man was delighted to hear her speak again   If it would not be too bold  said he   I  m a stranger in this part of the country  and come from afar off  My boy has got a bed for himself here in the village  but I have no place  Could you be so charitable as to give an old blind man a night  s lodging  Susan said she would step in and ask her mother  and she soon returned with an answer  that he was heartily welcome  if he could sleep upon the children  s bed  which was but small  The old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage  He struck his head against the low roof  as he stepped over the doorsill   Many roofs that are twice as high are not half so good  said he  Of this he had just had experience at the house of the Attorney Case  while he had asked  but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara  who was  according to her usual custom  standing staring at the hall door  The old man  s harp was set down in Farmer Price  s kitchen  and he promised to play a tune for the boys before they went to bed  their mother giving them leave to sit up to supper with their father  He came home with a sorrowful countenance  but how soon did it brighten  when Susan  with a smile  said to him   Father  we  ve good news for you  good news for us all  You have a whole week longer to stay with us  and perhaps  continued she  putting her little purse into his hands   perhaps with what  s here  and the bread bills  and what may somehow be got together before a week  s at an end  we may make up the nine guineas for the substitute  as they call him  Who knows  dearest mother  but we may keep him with us for ever  As she spoke  she threw her arms round her father  who pressed her to his bosom without speaking  for his heart was full  He was some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he heard was true  but the revived smiles of his wife  the noisy joy of his little boys  and the satisfaction that shone in Susan  s countenance  convinced him that he was not in a dream  As they sat down to supper  the old harper was made welcome to his share of the cheerful though frugal meal  Susan  s father  as soon as supper was finished  even before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys  opened the little purse  which Susan had given him  He was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings  and still more  when he came to the bottom of the purse  to see the bright golden guinea   How did you come by all this money  Susan  said he   Honestly and handsomely  that I  m sure of beforehand  said her proud mother   but how I can  t make out  except by the baking  Hey  Susan is this your first baking   Oh  no  no  said her father   I have her first baking snug here  besides  in my pocket  I kept it for a surprise  to do your mother  s heart good  Susan  Here  s twenty  nine shillings  and the Abbey bill  which is not paid yet  comes to ten more  What think you of this  wife  Have we not a right to be proud of our Susan  Why  continued he  turning to the harper   I ask your pardon for speaking out so free before strangers in praise of my own  which I know is not mannerly  but the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken  as I think  at all times  therefore  here  s your good health  Susan  why  by  and  by she  ll be worth her weight in gold  in silver at least  But tell us  child  how came you by all this riches  and how comes it that I don  t go to  morrow  All this happy news makes me so gay in myself  I  m afraid I shall hardly understand it rightly  But speak on  child  first bringing us a bottle of the good mead you made last year from your own honey  Susan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea  hen  of the gown and of her poor lamb  Part of this would seem as if she was vaunting of her own generosity  and part of it she did not like to recollect  But her mother pressed to know the whole  and she related it as simply as she could  When she came to the story of her lamb  her voice faltered  and everybody present was touched  The old harper sighed once  and cleared his throat several times  He then asked for his harp  and  after tuning it for a considerable time  he recollected  for he had often fits of absence  that he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys  This harper came from a great distance  from the mountains of Wales  to contend with several other competitors for a prize  which had been advertised by a musical society about a year before this time  There was to be a splendid ball given upon the occasion at Shrewsbury  which was about five miles from our village  The prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp  and the prize was now to be decided in a few days  All this intelligence Barbara had long since gained from her maid  who often paid visits to the town of Shrewsbury  and she had long had her imagination inflamed with the idea of this splendid music  meeting and ball  Often had she sighed to be there  and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for introducing herself to some GENTEEL neighbours  who might take her to the ball IN THEIR CARRIAGE  How rejoiced  how triumphant was she  when this very evening  just about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father about Susan  s lamb  a servant from the Abbey rapped at the door  and left a card for Mr  and Miss Barbara Case   There  cried Bab   _I_ and PAPA are to dine and drink tea at The Abbey tomorrow  Who knows  I daresay  when they see that I  m not a vulgar person  and all that  and if I go cunningly to work with Miss Somers  as I shall  to be sure  I daresay  she  ll take me to the ball with her   To be sure  said the maid   it  s the least one may expect from a lady who DEMEANS herself to visit Susan Price  and goes about a  shopping for her  The least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage  WHICH costs nothing  but is just a common civility  to a ball   Then pray  Betty  continued Miss Barbara   don  t forget to  morrow  the first thing you do  to send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet  I must have it to DINE IN  at the Abbey  or the ladies will think nothing of me  and Betty  remember the mantua  maker too  I must see and coax papa to buy me a new gown against the ball  I can see  you know  something of the fashions to  morrow at the Abbey  I shall LOOK THE LADIES WELL OVER  I promise you  And  Betty  I have thought of the most charming present for Miss Somers  as papa says it  s good never to go empty  handed to a great house  I  ll make Miss Somers  who is fond  as her maid told you  of such things  I  ll make Miss Somers a present of that guinea  hen of Susan  s  it  s of no use to me  so do you carry it up early in the morning to the Abbey  with my compliments  That  s the thing  In full confidence that her present and her bonnet would operate effectually in her favour  Miss Barbara paid her first visit at the Abbey  She expected to see wonders  She was dressed in all the finery which she had heard from her maid  who had heard from the  prentice of a Shrewsbury milliner  was THE THING in London  and she was much surprised and disappointed  when she was shown into the room where the Miss Somerses and the ladies of the Abbey were sitting  to see that they did not  in any one part of their dress  agree with the picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies  She was embarrassed when she saw books and work and drawings upon the table  and she began to think that some affront was meant to her  because the COMPANY did not sit with their hands before them  When Miss Somers endeavoured to find out conversation that would interest her  and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening  of which she was herself fond  Miss Barbara still thought herself undervalued  and soon contrived to expose her ignorance most completely  by talking of things which she did not understand  Those who never attempt to appear what they are not  those who do not in their manners pretend to anything unsuited to their habits and situation in life  never are in danger of being laughed at by sensible  well bred people of any rank  but affectation is the constant and just object of ridicule  Miss Barbara Case  with her mistaken airs of gentility  aiming to be thought a woman  and a fine lady  whilst she was  in reality  a child and a vulgar attorney  s daughter  rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous  that the good natured  yet discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel nothing for herself  One by one the ladies dropped off  Miss Somers went out of the room for a few minutes to alter her dress  as it was the custom of the family  before dinner  She left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints  for Miss Barbara  s amusement  but Miss Barbara  s thoughts were so intent upon the harpers  ball  that she could not be entertained with such TRIFLES  How unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation  They can never enjoy the present moment  Whilst Barbara was contriving means of interesting Miss Somers in her favour  she recollected  with surprise  that not one word had yet been said of her present of the guinea  hen  Mrs  Betty  in the hurry of her dressing her young lady in the morning  had forgotten it  but it came just whilst Miss Somers was dressing  and the housekeeper came into her mistress  room to announce its arrival   Ma  am  said she   here  s a beautiful guinea  hen just come  with Miss Barbara Case  s compliments to you  Miss Somers knew  by the tone which the housekeeper delivered this message  that there was something in the business which did not perfectly please her  She made no answer  in expectation that the housekeeper  who was a woman of a very open temper  would explain her cause of dissatisfaction  In this she was not mistaken  The housekeeper came close up to the dressing table  and continued   I never like to speak till I  m sure  ma  am  and I  m not quite sure  to say certain  in this case  ma  am  but still I think it right to tell you  which can  t wrong anybody  what came across my mind about this same guinea  hen  ma  am  and you can inquire into it  and do as you please afterwards  ma  am  Some time ago we had fine guinea  fowls of our own  and I made bold  not thinking  to be sure  that all our own would die away from us  as they have done  to give a fine couple last Christmas to Susan Price  and very fond and pleased she was at the time  and I  m sure would never have parted with the hen with her good  will  but if my eyes don  t strangely mistake  this hen  that comes from Miss Barbara  is the selfsame identical guinea  hen that I gave to Susan  And how Miss Bab came by it is the thing that puzzles me  If my boy Philip was at home  maybe  as he  s often at Mrs  Price  s ( which I don  t disapprove ) he might know the history of the guinea  hen  I expect him home this night  and if you have no objection  I will sift the affair   The shortest way  I think  said Henrietta   would be to ask Miss Case herself about it  which I will do this evening   If you please  ma  am  said the housekeeper  coldly  for she knew that Miss Barbara was not famous in the village for speaking truth  Dinner was now served  Attorney Case expected to smell mint sauce  and  as the covers were taken from off the dishes  looked around for lamb  but no lamb appeared  He had a dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point  Sir Arthur was speaking  when they sat down to dinner  of a new carving knife  which he lately had had made for his sister  The attorney immediately went from carving  knives to poultry  thence to butcher  s meat  Some joints  he observed  were much more difficult to carve than others  He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him  who was the curate of the parish   But  sir  said the vulgar attorney   I must make bold to differ with you in one point  and I  ll appeal to Sir Arthur  Sir Arthur  pray may I ask  when you carve a forequarter of lamb  do you  when you raise the shoulder  throw in salt  or not  This well prepared question was not lost upon Sir Arthur  The attorney was thanked for his intended present  but mortified and surprised to hear Sir Arthur say that it was a constant rule of his never to accept of any presents from his neighbours   If we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my estate  said he   I am afraid we should mortify many of our poor tenants  who can have little to offer  though  perhaps  they may bear us thorough good  will notwithstanding  After the ladies left the dining  room  as they were walking up and down the large hall  Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen father  s method of conversing  One of the ladies observed  that this hall would be a charming place for music  Bab brought in harps and harpers  and the harpers  ball  in a breath   I know so much about it  about the ball I mean  said she   because a lady in Shrewsbury  a friend of papa  s  offered to take me with her  but papa did not like to give her the trouble of sending so far for me  though she has a coach of her own  Barbara fixed her eyes upon Miss Somers as she spoke  but she could not read her countenance as distinctly as she wished  because Miss Somers was at this moment letting down the veil of her hat   Shall we walk out before tea  said Miss Somers to her companions   I have a pretty guinea  hen to show you  Barbara  secretly drawing propitious omens from the guinea  hen  followed with a confidential step  The pheasantry was well filled with pheasants  peacocks  etc  and Susan  s pretty little guinea  hen appeared well  even in this high company  It was much admired  Barbara was in glory  but her glory was of short duration  Just as Miss Somers was going to inquire into the guinea  hen  s history  Philip came up  to ask permission to have a bit of sycamore  to turn a nutmeg box for his mother  He was an ingenious lad  and a good turner for his age  Sir Arthur had put by a bit of sycamore  on purpose for him  and Miss Somers told him where it was to be found  He thanked her  but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea  hen  and he involuntarily exclaimed   Susan  s guinea  hen  I declare   No  it  s not Susan  s guinea  hen  said Miss Barbara  colouring furiously   it is mine  and I have made a present of it to Miss Somers  At the sound of Bab  s voice  Philip turned  saw her  and indignation  unrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators  flashed in his countenance   What is the matter  Philip  said Miss Somers  in a pacifying tone  but Philip was not inclined to be pacified   Why  ma  am  said he   may I speak out  and  without waiting for permission  he spoke out  and gave a full  true  and warm account of Rose  s embassy  and of Miss Barbara  s cruel and avaricious proceedings  Barbara denied  prevaricated  stammered  and at last was overcome with confusion  for which even the most indulgent spectators could scarcely pity her  Miss Somers  however  mindful of what was due to her guest  was anxious to dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore  Bab recovered herself as soon as he was out of sight  but she further exposed herself by exclaiming   I  m sure I wish this pitiful guinea  hen had never come into my possession  I wish Susan had kept it at home  as she should have done   Perhaps she will be more careful now that she has received so strong a lesson  said Miss Somers   Shall we try her  continued she   Philip will  I daresay  take the guinea  hen back to Susan  if we desire it   If you please  ma  am  said Barbara  sullenly   I have nothing more to do with it  So the guinea  hen was delivered to Philip  who set off joyfully with his prize  and was soon in sight of Farmer Price  s cottage  He stopped when he came to the door  He recollected Rose and her generous friendship for Susan  He was determined that she should have the pleasure of restoring the guinea  hen  He ran into the village  All the children who had given up their little purse on May day were assembled on the play  green  They were delighted to see the guinea  hen once more  Philip took his pipe and tabor  and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed cottage   Let me come with you  let me come with you  said the butcher  s boy to Philip   Stop one minute  my father has something to say to you  He darted into his father  s house  The little procession stopped  and in a few minutes the bleating of a lamb was heard  Through a back passage  which led into the paddock behind the house  they saw the butcher leading a lamb   It is Daisy  exclaimed Rose  It  s Daisy  repeated all her companions   Susan  s lamb  Susan  s lamb  and there was a universal shout of joy   Well  for my part  said the good butcher  as soon as he could be heard  for my part  I would not be so cruel as Attorney Case for the whole world  These poor brute beasts don  t know aforehand what  s going to happen to them  and as for dying  it  s what we must all do some time or another  but to keep wringing the hearts of the living  that have as much sense as one  s self  is what I call cruel  and is not this what Attorney Case has been doing by poor Susan and her whole family  ever since he took a spite against them  But  at anyrate  here  s Susan  s lamb safe and sound  I  d have taken it back sooner  but I was off before day to the fair  and am but just come back  Daisy  however  has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside  The obliging shopkeeper  who showed the pretty calicoes to Susan  was now at his door  and when he saw the lamb  and heard that it was Susan  s  and learned its history  he said that he would add his mite  and he gave the children some ends of narrow riband  with which Rose decorated her friend  s lamb  The pipe and tabor now once more began to play  and the procession moved on in joyful order  after giving the humane butcher three cheers  three cheers which were better deserved than  loud huzzas  usually are  Susan was working in her arbour  with her little deal table before her  When she heard the sound of the music  she put down her work and listened  She saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer  They had closed round Daisy  so that she did not see it  but as they came up to the garden gate she saw that Rose beckoned to her  Philip played as loud as he could  that she might not hear  till the proper moment  the bleating of the lamb  Susan opened the garden  wicket  and at this signal the crowd divided  and the first thing that Susan saw  in the midst of her taller friends  was little smiling Mary  with the guinea  hen in her arms   Come on  Come on  cried Mary  as Susan started with joyful surprise   you have more to see  At this instant the music paused  Susan heard the bleating of a lamb  and scarcely daring to believe her senses  she pressed eagerly forward  and beheld poor Daisy  she burst into tears   I did not shed one tear when I parted with you  my dear little Daisy  said she   It was for my father and mother  I would not have parted with you for anything else in the whole world  Thank you  thank you all  added she  to her companions  who sympathized in her joy  even more than they had sympathized in her sorrow   Now  if my father was not to go away from us next week  and if my mother was quite stout  I should be the happiest person in the world  As Susan pronounced these words  a voice behind the little listening crowd cried  in a brutal tone   Let us pass  if you please  you have no right to stop up the public road  This was the voice of Attorney Case  who was returning with his daughter Barbara from his visit to the Abbey  He saw the lamb  and tried to whistle as he went on  Barbara also saw the guinea  hen  and turned her head another way  that she might avoid the contemptuous  reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to despise  Even her new bonnet  in which she had expected to be so much admired  was now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her mortification   I am glad she saw the guinea  hen  cried Rose  who now held it in her hands   Yes  said Philip   she  ll not forget May day in a hurry   Nor I neither  I hope  said Susan  looking round upon her companions with a most affectionate smile   I hope  whilst I live  I shall never forget your goodness to me last May day  Now I  ve my pretty guinea  hen safe once more  I should think of returning your money   No  no  no  was the general cry   We don  t want the money  keep it  keep it  you want it for your father   Well  said Susan   I am not too proud to be obliged  I WILL keep your money for my father  Perhaps some time or other I may be able to earn   Oh  interrupted Philip   don  t let us talk of earning  don  t let us talk to her of money now  she has not had time hardly to look at poor Daisy and her guinea  hen  Come  we must go about our business  and let her have them all to herself  The crowd moved away in consequence of Philip  s considerate advice  but it was observed that he was the very last to stir from the garden  wicket himself  He stayed  first  to inform Susan that it was Rose who tied the ribands on Daisy  s head  Then he stayed a little longer to let her into the history of the guinea  hen  and to tell her who it was that brought the hen home from the Abbey  Rose held the sieve  and Susan was feeding her long lost favourite  whilst Philip leaned over the wicket  prolonging his narration   Now  my pretty guinea  hen  said Susan  my naughty guinea  hen  that flew away from me  you shall never serve me so again  I must cut your nice wings  but I won  t hurt you   Take care  cried Philip   you  d better  indeed you  d better let me hold her whilst you cut her wings  When this operation was successfully performed  which it certainly could never have been if Philip had not held the hen for Susan  he recollected that his mother had sent him with a message to Mrs  Price  This message led to another quarter of an hour  s delay  for he had the whole history of the guinea  hen to tell over again to Mrs  Price  and the farmer himself luckily came in whilst it was going on  so it was but civil to begin it afresh  and then the farmer was so rejoiced to see his Susan so happy again with her two little favourites that he declared he must see Daisy fed himself  and Philip found that he was wanted to hold the jug full of milk  out of which Farmer Price filled the pan for Daisy  Happy Daisy  who lapped at his ease  whilst Susan caressed him  and thanked her fond father and her pleased mother   But  Philip  said Mrs  Price   I  ll hold the jug  you  ll be late with your message to your mother  we  ll not detain you any longer  Philip departed  and as he went out of the garden  wicket  he looked up  and saw Bab and her maid Betty staring out of the window  as usual  On this  he immediately turned back to try whether he had shut the gate fast  lest the guinea  hen might stray out  and fall again into the hands of the enemy  Miss Barbara  in the course of this day  felt considerable mortification  but no contrition  She was vexed that her meanness was discovered  but she felt no desire to cure herself of any of her faults  The ball was still uppermost in her vain  selfish soul   Well  said she to her confidante  Betty   you hear how things have turned out  but if Miss Somers won  t think of asking me to go out with her  I  ve a notion I know who will  As papa says  it  s a good thing to have two strings to one  s bow  Now  some officers  who were quartered at Shrewsbury  had become acquainted with Mr  Case  They had gotten into some quarrel with a tradesman of the town  and Attorney Case had promised to bring them through the affair  as the man threatened to take the law of them  Upon the faith of this promise  and with the vain hope that  by civility  they might dispose him to bring in a REASONABLE bill of costs  these officers sometimes invited Mr  Case to the mess  and one of them  who had lately been married  prevailed upon his bride SOMETIMES to take a little notice of Miss Barbara  It was with this lady that Miss Barbara now hoped to go to the harpers  ball   The officers and Mrs  Strathspey  or  more properly  Mrs  Strathspey and the officers  are to breakfast here  tomorrow  do you know  said Bab to Betty   One of them dined at the Abbey  to  day  and told papa that they  d all come  They are going out on a party  somewhere into the country  and breakfast here on their way  Pray  Betty  don  t forget that Mrs  Strathspey can  t breakfast without honey  I heard her say so myself   Then  indeed  said Betty   I  m afraid Mrs  Strathspey will be likely to go without her breakfast here  for not a spoonful of honey have we  let her long for it ever so much   But  surely  said Bab   we can contrive to get some honey in the neighbourhood   There  s none to be bought  as I know of  said Betty   But is there none to be begged or borrowed  said Bab  laughing   Do you forget Susan  s beehive  Step over to her in the morning with MY COMPLIMENTS  and see what you can do  Tell her it  s for Mrs  Strathspey  In the morning Betty went with Miss Barbara  s compliments to Susan  to beg some honey for Mrs  Strathspey  who could not breakfast without it  Susan did not like to part with her honey  because her mother loved it  and she therefore gave Betty but a small quantity  When Barbara saw how little Susan sent  she called her A MISER  and she said she MUST have some more for Mrs  Strathspey   I  ll go myself and speak to her  Come with me  Betty  said the young lady  who found it at present convenient to forget her having declared  the day that she sucked up the broth  that she never would honour Susan with another visit   Susan  said she  accosting the poor girl  whom she had done everything in her power to injure   I must beg a little more honey from you for Mrs  Strathspey  s breakfast  You know  on a particular occasion such as this  neighbours must help one another   To be sure they should  added Betty  Susan  though she was generous  was not weak  she was willing to give to those she loved  but not disposed to let anything be taken from her  or coaxed out of her  by those she had reason to despise  She civilly answered  that she was sorry she had no more honey to spare  Barbara grew angry  and lost all command of herself  when she saw that Susan  without regarding her reproaches  went on looking through the glass pane in the beehive   I  ll tell you what  Susan Price  said she  in a high tone   the honey I WILL have  so you may as well give it to me by fair means  Yes or no  Speak  Will you give it me or not  Will you give me that piece of the honey  comb that lies there   That bit of honey  comb is for my mother  s breakfast  said Susan   I cannot give it you   Can  t you  said Bab   then see if I don  t take it  She stretched across Susan for the honey  comb  which was lying by some rosemary leaves that Susan had freshly gathered for her mother  s tea  Bab grasped  but at her first effort she only reached the rosemary  She made a second dart at the honey  comb  and  in her struggle to obtain it  she overset the beehive  The bees swarmed about her  Her maid Betty screamed and ran away  Susan  who was sheltered by a laburnum tree  called to Barbara  upon whom the black clusters of bees were now settling  and begged her to stand still  and not to beat them away   If you stand quietly you won  t be stung  perhaps  But instead of standing quietly  Bab buffeted and stamped and roared  and the bees stung her terribly  Her arms and her face swelled in a frightful manner  She was helped home by poor Susan and treacherous Mrs  Betty  who  now the mischief was done  thought only of exculpating herself to her master   Indeed  Miss Barbara  said she   this was quite wrong of you to go and get yourself into such a scrape  I shall be turned away for it  you  ll see   I don  t care whether you are turned away or not  said Barbara   I never felt such pain in my life  Can  t you do something for me  I don  t mind the pain either so much as being such a fright  Pray  how am I to be fit to be seen at breakfast by Mrs  Strathspey  and I suppose I can  t go to the ball either to  morrow  after all   No  that you can  t expect to do  indeed  said Betty  the comforter   You need not think of balls  for those lumps and swellings won  t go off your face this week  That  s not what pains me  but I  m thinking of what your papa will say to me when he sees you  miss  Whilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity reviling one another  Susan  when she saw that she could be of no further use  was preparing to depart  but at the house  door  she was met by Mr  Case  Mr  Case had revolved things in his mind  for his second visit at the Abbey pleased him as little as his first  owing to a few words which Sir Arthur and Miss Somers dropped in speaking of Susan and Farmer Price  Mr  Case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family  The refusal of his present dwelt upon the attorney  s mind  and he was aware that  if the history of Susan  s lamb ever reached the Abbey  he was undone  He now thought that the most prudent course he could possibly follow would be to HUSH UP matters with the Prices with all convenient speed  Consequently  when he met Susan at his door  he forced a gracious smile   How is your mother  Susan  said he   Is there anything in our house can be of service to her  On hearing his daughter he cried out   Barbara  Barbara  Bab  come downstairs  child  and speak to Susan Price  But as no Barbara answered  her father stalked upstairs directly  opened the door  and stood amazed at the spectacle of her swelled visage  Betty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara  s mishap her own way  Bab contradicted her as fast as she spoke  The attorney turned the maid away on the spot  and partly with real anger  and partly with feigned affectation of anger  he demanded from his daughter how she dared to treat Susan Price so ill   when  as he said   she was so neighbourly and obliging as to give you some of her honey  Couldn  t you be content  without seizing upon the honey  comb by force  This is scandalous behaviour  and what  I assure you  I can  t countenance  Susan now interceded for Barbara  and the attorney  softening his voice  said that  Susan was a great deal too good to her  as you are  indeed  added he   to everybody  I forgive her for your sake  Susan curtsied  in great surprise  but her lamb could not be forgotten  and she left the attorney  s house as soon as she could  to make her mother  s rosemary tea breakfast  Mr  Case saw that Susan was not so simple as to be taken in by a few fair words  His next attempt was to conciliate Farmer Price  The farmer was a blunt  honest man  and his countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous  when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone  So stood matters the day of the long expected harpers  ball  Miss Barbara Case  stung by Susan  s bees  could not  after all her manoeuvres  go with Mrs  Strathspey to the ball  The ballroom was filled early in the evening  There was a numerous assembly  The harpers  who contended for the prize  were placed under the music  gallery at the lower end of the room  Amongst them was our old blind friend  who  as he was not so well clad as his competitors  seemed to be disdained by many of the spectators  Six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the performance  They were seated in a semicircle  opposite to the harpers  The Miss Somerses  who were fond of music  were amongst the ladies in the semicircle  and the prize was lodged in the hands of Sir Arthur  There was now silence  The first harp sounded  and as each musician tried his skill  the audience seemed to think that each deserved the prize  The old blind man was the last  He tuned his instrument  and such a simple  pathetic strain was heard as touched every heart  All were fixed in delighted attention  and when the music ceased  the silence for some moments continued  The silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause  The judges were unanimous in their opinions  and it was declared that the old blind harper  who played the last  deserved the prize  The simple  pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole assembly  was his own composition  He was pressed to give the words belonging to the music  and at last he modestly offered to repeat them  as he could not see to write  Miss Somers  ready pencil was instantly produced  and the old harper dictated the words of his ballad  which he called   Susan  s Lamentation for her Lamb  Miss Somers looked at her brother from time to time  as she wrote  and Sir Arthur  as soon as the old man had finished  took him aside  and asked him some questions  which brought the whole history of Susan  s lamb and of Attorney Case  s cruelty to light  The attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his ballad  His colour  as Sir Arthur steadily looked at him  varied continually  till at length  when he heard the words  Susan  s Lamentation for her Lamb  he suddenly shrunk back  skulked through the crowd  and disappeared  We shall not follow him  we had rather follow our old friend  the victorious harper  No sooner had he received the ten guineas  his well merited prize  than he retired to a small room belonging to the people of the house  asked for pen  ink and paper  and dictated  in a low voice  to his boy  who was a tolerably good scribe  a letter  which he ordered him to put directly into the Shrewsbury post  office  The boy ran with the letter to the post  office  He was but just in time  for the postman  s horn was sounding  The next morning  when Farmer Price  his wife  and Susan  were sitting together  reflecting that his week  s leave of absence was nearly at an end  and that the money was not yet made up for John Simpson  the substitute  a knock was heard at the door  and the person who usually delivered the letters in the village put a letter into Susan  s hand  saying   A penny  if you please  here  s a letter for your father   For me  said Farmer Price   here  s the penny then  but who can it be from  I wonder  Who can think of writing to me  in this world  He tore open the letter  but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled him   your obliged friend  Llewellyn   And what  s this  said he  opening a paper that was inclosed in the letter   It  s a song  seemingly  it must be somebody that has a mind to make an April fool of me   But it is not April  it is May  father  said Susan   Well  let us read the letter  and we shall come to the truth all in good time  Farmer Price sat down in his own chair  for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other  and read as follows   MY WORTHY FRIEND  I am sure you will be glad to hear that I have had good success this night  I have won the ten guinea prize  and for that I am in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter Susan  as you will see by a little ballad I inclose for her  Your hospitality to me has afforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history  You do not  I hope  forget that I was present when you were counting the treasure in Susan  s little purse  and that I heard for what purpose it was all destined  You have not  I know  yet made up the full sum for your substitute  John Simpson  therefore do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will find within the ballad  You shall not find me as hard a creditor as Attorney Case  Pay me the money at your own convenience  If it is never convenient to you to pay it  I shall never ask it  I shall go my rounds again through this country  I believe  about this time next year  and will call to see how you do  and to play the new tune for Susan and the dear little boys   I should just add  to set your heart at rest about the money  that it does not distress me at all to lend it to you  I am not quite so poor as I appear to be  But it is my humour to go about as I do  I see more of the world under my tattered garb than  perhaps  I should ever see in a better dress  There are many of my profession who are of the same mind as myself in this respect  and we are glad  when it lies in our way  to do any kindness to such a worthy family as yours  So  fare ye well   Your obliged Friend   LLEWELLYN  Susan now  by her father  s desire  opened the ballad  He picked up the five guinea bank note  whilst she read  with surprise   Susan  s Lamentation for her Lamb  Her mother leaned over her shoulder to read the words  but they were interrupted  before they had finished the first stanza  by another knock at the door  It was not the postman with another letter  It was Sir Arthur and his sisters  They came with an intention  which they were much disappointed to find that the old harper had rendered vain  they came to lend the farmer and his good family the money to pay for his substitute   But  since we are here  said Sir Arthur   let me do my own business  which I had like to have forgotten  Mr  Price  will you come out with me  and let me show you a piece of your land  through which I want to make a road  Look there  said Sir Arthur  pointing to the spot   I am laying out a ride round my estate  and that bit of land of yours stops me   Why  sir  said Price   the land  s mine  to be sure  for that matter  but I hope you don  t look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about a trifle or so   The fact is  said Sir Arthur   I had heard you were a litigious  pig  headed fellow  but you do not seem to deserve this character   Hope not  sir  said the farmer   but about the matter of the land  I don  t want to take any advantage of your wishing for it  You are welcome to it  and I leave it to you to find me out another bit of land convenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less  or else to make up the value to me some way or other  I need say no more about it   I hear something  continued Sir Arthur  after a short silence  I hear something  Mr  Price  of a FLAW in your lease  I would not speak to you about it whilst we were bargaining about your land  lest I should over  awe you  but  tell me  what is this flaw   In truth  and the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken at all times  said the farmer   I didn  t know myself what a flaw  as they call it  meant  till I heard of the word from Attorney Case  and  I take it  a flaw is neither more nor less than a mistake  as one should say  Now  by reason a man does not make a mistake on purpose  it seems to me to be the fair thing  that if a man finds out his mistake  he might set it right  but Attorney Case says this is not law  and I  ve no more to say  The man who drew up my lease made a mistake  and if I must suffer for it  I must  said the farmer   However  I can show you  Sir Arthur  just for my own satisfaction and yours  a few lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper  which was given me by your relation  the gentleman who lived here before  and let me my farm  You  ll see  by that bit of paper  what was meant  but the attorney says  the paper  s not worth a button in a court of justice  and I don  t understand these things  All I understand is the common honesty of the matter  I  ve no more to say   This attorney  whom you speak of so often  said Sir Arthur   you seem to have some quarrel with  Now  would you tell me frankly what is the matter between   The matter between us  then  said Price   is a little bit of ground  not worth much  that is there open to the lane at the end of Mr  Case  s garden  sir  and he wanted to take it in  Now I told him my mind  that it belonged to the parish  and that I never would willingly give my consent to his cribbing it in that way  Sir  I was the more loath to see it shut into his garden  which  moreover  is large enough of all conscience without it  because you must know  Sir Arthur  the children in our village are fond of making a little play  green of it  and they have a custom of meeting on May day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of it  and altogether I was very loath to see  em turned out of it by those who have no right   Let us go and see this nook  said Sir Arthur   It is not far off  is it   Oh  no  sir  just hard by here  When they got to the ground  Mr  Case  who saw them walking together  was in a hurry to join them  that he might put a stop to any explanations  Explanations were things of which he had a great dread  but  fortunately  he was upon this occasion a little too late   Is this the nook in dispute  said Sir Arthur   Yes  this is the whole thing  said Price   Why  Sir Arthur  interposed the politic attorney  with an assumed air of generosity   don  t let us talk any more about it  Let it belong to whom it will  I give it up to you   So great a lawyer  Mr  Case  as you are  replied Sir Arthur   must know  that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title  and in this case it is impossible that  with the best intentions to oblige me in the world  you can give up this bit of land to me  because it is mine already  as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land  which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers  This piece of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road  and it was cut off when the lane was made   Very possibly  I daresay you are quite correct  you must know best  said the attorney  trembling for the agency   Then  said Sir Arthur   Mr  Price  you will observe that I now promise this little green to the children for a play  ground  and I hope they may gather hawthorn many a May day at this their favourite bush  Mr  Price bowed low  which he seldom did  even when he received a favour himself   And now  Mr  Case  said Sir Arthur  turning to the attorney  who did not know which way to look   you sent me a lease to look over   Ye  ye  yes  stammered Mr Case   I thought it my duty to do so  not out of any malice or ill  will to this good man   You have done him no injury  said Sir Arthur  coolly   I am ready to make him a new lease  whenever he pleases  of his farm  and I shall be guided by a memorandum of the original bargain  which he has in his possession  I hope I never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone   Heaven forbid  sir  said the attorney  sanctifying his face   that I should suggest the taking an UNFAIR advantage of any man  rich or poor  but to break a bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage   You really think so  said Sir Arthur   Certainly I do  and I hope I have not hazarded your good opinion by speaking my mind concerning the flaw so plainly  I always understood that there could be nothing ungentlemanlike  in the way of business  in taking advantage of a flaw in a lease   Now  said Sir Arthur   you have pronounced judgment undesignedly in your own case  You intended to send me this poor man  s lease  but your son  by some mistake  brought me your own  and I have discovered a fatal error in it   A fatal error  said the alarmed attorney   Yes  sir  said Sir Arthur  pulling the lease out of his pocket   Here it is  You will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor   But  you won  t take advantage of me  surely  Sir Arthur  said Mr  Case  forgetting his own principles   I shall not take advantage of you  as you would have taken of this honest man  In both cases I shall be guided by memoranda which I have in my possession  I shall not  Mr  Case  defraud you of one shilling of your property  I am ready  at a fair valuation  to pay the exact value of your house and land  but upon this condition  that you quit the parish within one month  Attorney Case was thus compelled to submit to the hard necessity of the case  for he knew that he could not legally resist  Indeed he was glad to be let off so easily  and he bowed and sneaked away  secretly comforting himself with the hope  that when they came to the valuation of the house and land he should be the gainer  perhaps of a few guineas  His reputation he justly held very cheap   You are a scholar  you write a good hand  you can keep accounts  cannot you  said Sir Arthur to Mr  Price  as they walked home towards the cottage   I think I saw a bill of your little daughter  s drawing out the other day  which was very neatly written  Did you teach her to write   No  sir  said Price   I can  t say I did THAT  for she mostly taught it herself  but I taught her a little arithmetic  as far as I knew  on our winter nights  when I had nothing better to do   Your daughter shows that she has been well taught  said Sir Arthur   and her good conduct and good character speak strongly in favour of her parents   You are very good  very good indeed  sir  to speak in this sort of way  said the delighted father   But I mean to do more than PAY YOU WITH WORDS  said Sir Arthur   You are attached to your own family  perhaps you may become attached to me  when you come to know me  and we shall have frequent opportunities of judging of one another  I want no agent to squeeze my tenants  or do my dirty work  I only want a steady  intelligent  honest man  like you  to collect my rents  and I hope  Mr  Price  you will have no objection to the employment   I hope  sir  said Price  with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest countenance   that you  ll never have cause to repent your goodness   And what are my sisters about here  said Sir Arthur  entering the cottage  and going behind his sisters  who were busily engaged in measuring an extremely pretty coloured calico   It is for Susan  my dear brother  said they   I know she did not keep that guinea for herself  said Miss Somers   I have just prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it  Susan gave it to her father  but she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time  and I am sure she will not  because her mother  I see  likes it  And  Susan  I hear that instead of becoming Queen of the May this year  you were sitting in your sick mother  s room  Your mother has a little colour in her cheeks now   Oh  ma  am  interrupted Mrs  Price   I  m quite well  Joy  I think  has made me quite well   Then  said Miss Somers   I hope you will be able to come out on your daughter  s birthday  which  I hear  is the th of this month  Make haste and get quite well before that day  for my brother intends that all the lads and lassies of the village shall have a dance on Susan  s birthday   Yes  said Sir Arthur   and I hope on that day  Susan  you will be very happy with your little friends upon their play  green  I shall tell them that it is your good conduct which has obtained it for them  and if you have anything to ask  any little favour for any of your companions  which we can grant  now ask  Susan  These ladies look as if they would not refuse you anything that is reasonable  and  I think  you look as if you would not ask anything unreasonable   Sir  said Susan  after consulting her mother  s eyes   there is  to be sure  a favour I should like to ask  it is for Rose   Well  I don  t know who Rose is  said Sir Arthur  smiling   but  go on   Ma  am  you have seen her  I believe  she is a very good girl  indeed  said Mrs  Price   And works very neatly  indeed  continued Susan  eagerly  to Miss Somers   and she and her mother heard you were looking out for someone to wait upon you   Say no more  said Miss Somers   your wish is granted  Tell Rose to come to the Abbey  to  morrow morning  or  rather  come with her yourself  for our housekeeper  I know  wants to talk to you about a certain cake  She wishes  Susan  that you should be the maker of the cake for the dance  and she has good things ready looked out for it already  I know  It must be large enough for everybody to have a slice  and the housekeeper will ice it for you  I only hope your cake will be as good as your bread  Fare ye well  How happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family  silent with gratitude  who will bless them aloud when they are far out of hearing   How do I wish  now  said Farmer Price   and it  s almost a sin for one that has had such a power of favours done him  to wish for anything more  but how I DO wish  wife  that our good friend  the harper was only here at this time  It would do his old  warm heart good  Well  the best of it is  we shall be able next year  when he comes his rounds  to pay him his money with thanks  being all the time  and for ever  as much obliged to him as if we kept it  I long  so I do  to see him in this house again  drinking  as he did  just in this spot  a glass of Susan  s mead  to her very good health   Yes  said Susan   and the next time he comes  I can give him one of my guinea  hen  s eggs  and I shall show my lamb  Daisy   True  love  said her mother   and he will play that tune and sing that pretty ballad  Where is it  for I have not finished it   Rose ran away with it  mother  but I  ll step after her  and bring it back to you this minute  said Susan  Susan found her friend Rose at the hawthorn  in the midst of a crowded circle of her companions  to whom she was reading  Susan  s Lamentation for her Lamb   The words are something  but the tune  the tune  I must have the tune  cried Philip   I  ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find out which way that good old man went after the ball  and if he  s above ground  we  ll have him back by Susan  s birthday  and he shall sit here  just exactly here by this  our bush  and he shall play  I mean  if he pleases  that same tune for us  and I shall learn it  I mean  if I can  in a minute  The good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect the rents  and that Attorney Case was to leave the parish in a month  soon spread over the village  Many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of hearing the joyful tidings confirmed by Susan herself  The crowd on the play  green increased every minute   Yes  cried the triumphant Philip   I tell you it  s all true  every word of it  Susan  s too modest to say it herself  but I tell ye all  Sir Arthur gave us this play  green for ever  on account of her being so good  You see  at last Attorney Case  with all his cunning has not proved a match for  Simple Susan  THE WHITE PIGEON  The little town of Somerville  in Ireland  has  within these few years  assumed the neat and cheerful appearance of an English village  Mr  Somerville  to whom this town belongs  wished to inspire his tenantry with a taste for order and domestic happiness  and took every means in his power to encourage industrious  well behaved people to settle in his neighbourhood  When he had finished building a row of good slated houses in his town  he declared that he would let them to the best tenants he could find  and proposals were publicly sent to him from all parts of the country  By the best tenants  Mr  Somerville did not  however  mean the best bidders  and many  who had offered an extravagant price for the houses  were surprised to find their proposals rejected  Amongst these was Mr  Cox  an alehouse keeper  who did not bear a very good character   Please your honour  sir  said he to Mr  Somerville   I expected  since I bid as fair and fairer for it than any other  that you would have let me the house next the apothecary  s  Was not it fifteen guineas I mentioned in my proposal  and did not your honour give it against me for thirteen   My honour did just so  replied Mr  Somerville  calmly   And please your honour  but I don  t know what it is I or mine have done to offend you  I  m sure there is not a gentleman in all Ireland I  d go further to sarve  Would not I go to Cork to  morrow for the least word from your honour   I am much obliged to you  Mr  Cox  but I have no business at Cork at present  answered Mr  Somerville  drily   It is all I wish  exclaimed Mr  Cox   that I could find out and light upon the man that has belied me to your honour   No man has belied you  Mr  Cox  but your nose belies you much  if you do not love drinking a little  and your black eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a little   Quarrel  I quarrel  please your honour  I defy any man  or set of men  ten mile round  to prove such a thing  and I am ready to fight him that dares to say the like of me  I  d fight him here in your honour  s presence  if he  d only come out this minute  and meet me like a man  Here Mr  Cox put himself into a boxing attitude  but observing that Mr  Somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile  and that several people  who had gathered round him as he stood in the street  laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition  he changed his attitude  and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking   And as to drink  please your honour  there  s no truth in it  Not a drop of whisky  good or bad  have I touched these six months  except what I took with Jemmy M  Doole the night I had the misfortune to meet your honour coming home from the fair of Ballynagrish  To this speech Mr  Somerville made no answer  but turned away to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn  which the glazier was at this instant glazing   Please your honour  that new inn is not let  I hear  as yet  resumed Mr  Cox   if your honour recollects  you promised to make me a compliment of it last Seraphtide was twelvemonth   Impossible  cried Mr  Somerville   for I had no thoughts of building an inn at that time   Oh  I beg your honour  s pardon but if you  d be just pleased to recollect  it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows  FORENENT Thady O  Connor  you made me the promise  I  ll leave it to him  so I will   But I will not leave it to him  I assure you  cried Mr  Somerville   I never made any such promise  I never thought of letting this inn to you   Then your honour won  t let me have it   No  you have told me a dozen falsehoods  I do not wish to have you for a tenant   Well  God bless your honour  I  ve no more to say  but God bless your honour  said Mr  Cox  and he walked away  muttering to himself  as he slouched his hat over his face   I hope I  ll live to be revenged on him  Mr  Somerville the next morning went with his family to look at the new inn  which he expected to see perfectly finished  but he was met by the carpenter  who  with a rueful face  informed him that six panes of glass in the large bow  window had been broken during the night   Ha  perhaps Mr  Cox has broken my windows  in revenge for my refusing to let him my house  said Mr  Somerville  and many of the neighbours  who knew the malicious character of this Mr  Cox  observed that this was like one of his tricks  A boy of about twelve years old  however  stepped forward and said   I don  t like Mr  Cox  I  m sure  for once he beat me when he was drunk  but  for all that  no one should be accused wrongfully  He could not be the person that broke these windows last night  for he was six miles off  He slept at his cousin  s last night  and he has not returned home yet  So I think he knows nothing of the matter  Mr  Somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this boy  and observing that he looked in eagerly at the staircase  when the house door was opened  he asked him whether he would like to go in and see the new house   Yes  sir  said the boy   I should like to go up those stairs  and to see what I should come to   Up with you  then  said Mr  Somerville  and the boy ran up the stairs  He went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and delight  At length  as he was examining one of the garrets  he was startled by a fluttering noise over his head  and looking up  he saw a white pigeon  who  frightened at his appearance  began to fly round and round the room  till it found its way out of the door  and flew into the staircase  The carpenter was speaking to Mr  Somerville upon the landing  place of the stairs  but  the moment he spied the white pigeon  he broke off in the midst of a speech about THE NOSE of the stairs  and exclaimed   There he is  please your honour  There  s he that has done all the damage to our bow  window  that  s the very same wicked white pigeon that broke the church windows last Sunday was se  nnight  but he  s down for it now  we have him safe  and I  ll chop his head off  as he deserves  this minute   Stay  O stay  don  t chop his head off  he does not deserve it  cried the boy  who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagerness   _I_ broke your window  sir  said he to Mr  Somerville   I broke your window with this ball  but I did not know that I had done it  till this moment  I assure you  or I should have told you before  Don  t chop his head off  added the boy to the carpenter  who had now the white pigeon in his hands   No  said Mr  Somerville   the pigeon  s head shall not be chopped off  nor yours either  my good boy  for breaking a window  I am persuaded by your open  honest countenance  that you are speaking the truth  but pray explain this matter to us  for you have not made it quite clear  How happened it that you could break my windows without knowing it  and how came you to find it out at last   Sir  said the boy   if you  ll come up here  I  ll show you all I know  and how I came to know it  Mr  Somerville followed the boy into the garret  who pointed to a pane of glass that was broken in a small window that looked out upon a piece of waste ground behind the house  Upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play   We were playing there at ball yesterday evening  continued the boy  addressing himself to Mr  Somerville   and one of the lads challenged me to hit a mark in the wall  which I did  but he said I did not hit it  and bade me give him up my ball as the forfeit  This I would not do  and when he began to wrestle with me for it  I threw the ball  as I thought  over the house  He ran to look for it in the street  but could not find it  which I was very glad of  but I was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this heap of shavings  sir  under this broken window  for  as soon as I saw it lying there  I knew I must have been the person that broke the window  and through this window came the white pigeon  Here  s one of his white feathers sticking in the gap   Yes  said the carpenter   and in the bow  window room below there  s plenty of his feathers to be seen  for I  ve just been down to look  It was the pigeon broke THEM windows  sure enough   But he could not have got in had I not broke this little window  said the boy  eagerly   and I am able to earn sixpence a day  and I  ll pay for all the mischief  and welcome  The white pigeon belongs to a poor neighbour  a friend of ours  who is very fond of him  and I would not have him killed for twice as much money   Take the pigeon  my honest  generous lad  said Mr  Somerville   and carry him back to your neighbour  I forgive him all the mischief he has done me  tell your friend  for your sake  As to the rest  we can have the windows mended  and do you keep all the sixpences you earn for yourself   That  s what he never did yet  said the carpenter   Many  s the sixpence he earns  but not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket  it goes every farthing to his poor father and mother  Happy for them to have such a son   More happy for him to have such a father and mother  exclaimed the boy   Their good days they took all the best care of me that was to be had for love or money  and would  if I would let them  go on paying for my schooling now  falling as they be in the world  but I must learn to mind the shop now  Good morning to you  sir  and thank you kindly  said he to Mr  Somerville   And where does this boy live  and who are his father and mother  They cannot live in town  said Mr  Somerville   or I should have heard of them   They are but just come into the town  please your honour  said the carpenter   They lived formerly upon Counsellor O  Donnel  s estate  but they were ruined  please your honour  by taking a joint lease with a man  who fell afterwards into bad company  ran out all he had  so could not pay the landlord  and these poor people were forced to pay his share and their own too  which almost ruined them  They were obliged to give up the land  and now they have furnished a little shop in this town with what goods they could afford to buy with the money they got by the sale of their cattle and stock  They have the good  will of all who know them  and I am sure I hope they will do well  The boy is very ready in the shop  though he said only that he could earn sixpence a day  He writes a good hand  and is quick at casting up accounts  for his age  Besides  he is likely to do well in the world  because he is never in idle company  and I  ve known him since he was two foot high  and never heard of his telling a lie   This is an excellent character of the boy  indeed  said Mr  Somerville   and from his behaviour this morning I am inclined to think that he deserves all your praises  Mr  Somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this poor family  and to attend to their conduct himself  fully determined to assist them if he should find them such as they had been represented  In the meantime  this boy  whose name was Brian O  Neill  went to return the white pigeon to its owner   You have saved its life  said the woman to whom it belonged   and I  ll make you a present of it  Brian thanked her  and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon  He always took care to scatter some oats for it in his father  s yard  and the pigeon grew so tame at last that it would hop about the kitchen  and eat off the same trencher with the dog  Brian  after the shop was shut up at night  used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him  Amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the history of birds and beasts  he looked immediately to see whether the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds  and  to his great joy  he found a full description and history of his favourite bird   So  Brian  I see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you  you like your book  I see  when you have no master over you to bid you read  said his father  when he came in and saw Brian reading his book very attentively   Thank you for having me taught to read  father  said Brian   Here I  ve made a great discovery  I  ve found out in this book  little as it looks  father  a most curious way of making a fortune  and I hope it will make your fortune  father  and if you  ll sit down  I  ll tell it to you  Mr  O  Neill  in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in the expectation of having his fortune made  immediately sat down to listen  and his son explained to him  that he had found in his book an account of pigeons who carried notes and letters   and  father  continued Brian   I find my pigeon is of this sort  and I intend to make my pigeon carry messages  Why should not he  If other pigeons have done so before him  I think he is as good  and  I daresay  will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the world  I shall begin to teach him to  morrow morning  and then  father  you know people often pay a great deal for sending messengers  and no boy can run  no horse can gallop  so fast as a bird can fly  therefore the bird must be the best messenger  and I should be paid the best price  Hey  father   To be sure  to be sure  my boy  said his father  laughing   I wish you may make the best messenger in Ireland of your pigeon  but all I beg  my dear boy  is that you won  t neglect our shop for your pigeon  for I  ve a notion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop than by the white pigeon  Brian never neglected the shop  but in his leisure hours he amused himself with training his pigeon  and after much patience he at last succeeded so well  that one day he went to his father and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound in the market of Ballynagrish  where he was going   The pigeon will be home long before me  father  and he will come in at the kitchen window  and light upon the dresser  then you must untie the little note which I shall have tied under his left wing  and you  ll know the price of beef directly  The pigeon carried his message well  and Brian was much delighted with his success  He soon was employed by the neighbours  who were aroused by Brian  s fondness of his swift messenger  and soon the fame of the white pigeon was spread amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of Somerville  At one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink  and to concert plans of robberies  Their place of meeting was at the ale  house of Mr  Cox  the man who  as our readers may remember  was offended by Mr  Somerville  s hinting that he was fond of drinking and of quarrelling  and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new inn  Whilst these men were talking over their scheme  one of them observed  that one of their companions was not arrived  Another said   No   He  s six miles off  said another  and a third wished that he could make him hear at that distance  This turned the discourse upon the difficulties of sending messages secretly and quickly  Cox  s son  a lad of about nineteen  who was one of this gang  mentioned the white carrier  pigeon  and he was desired to try all means to get it into his possession  Accordingly  the next day young Cox went to Brian O  Neill  and tried  at first by persuasion and afterwards by threats  to prevail upon him to give up the pigeon  Brian was resolute in his refusal  more especially when the petitioner began to bully him   If we can  t have it by fair means  we will by foul  said Cox  and a few days afterwards the pigeon was gone  Brian searched for it in vain  inquired from all the neighbours if they had seen it  and applied  but to no purpose  to Cox  He swore that he knew nothing about the matter  But this was false  for it was he who during the night  time had stolen the white pigeon  He conveyed it to his employers  and they rejoiced that they had gotten it into their possession  as they thought it would serve them for a useful messenger  Nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning  The very means which these people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their plots to light  They endeavoured to teach the pigeon  which they had stolen  to carry messages for them in a part of the country at some distance from Somerville  and when they fancied that it had forgotten its former habits  and its old master  they thought that they might venture to employ him nearer home  The pigeon  however  had a better memory than they imagined  They loosed him from a bag near the town of Ballynagrish in hopes that he would stop at the house of Cox  s cousin  which was on its road between Ballynagrish and Somerville  But the pigeon  though he had been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial  did not stop there  but flew on to his old master  s house in Somerville  and pecked at the kitchen window  as he had formerly been taught to do  His father  fortunately  was within hearing  and poor Brian ran with the greatest joy to open the window and to let him in   O  father  here  s my white pigeon come back of his own accord  exclaimed Brian   I must run and show him to my mother  At this instant the pigeon spread his wings  and Brian discovered under one of its wings a small and very dirty looking billet  He opened it in his father  s presence  The scrawl was scarcely legible  but these words were at length deciphered   Thare are eight of uz sworn  I send yo at botom thare names  We meat at tin this nite at my faders  and have harms and all in radiness to brak into the grate  ouse  Mr  Summervill is to lye out to nite  kip the pigeon untill to  morrow  For ever yours  MURTAGH COX  JUN  Scarcely had they finished reading this note  than both father and son exclaimed   Let us go and show it to Mr  Somerville  Before they set out  they had  however  the prudence to secure the pigeon  so that he should not be seen by anyone but themselves  Mr  Somerville  in consequence of this fortunate discovery  took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house  When they were all safely lodged in the county gaol  he sent for Brian O  Neill and his father  and after thanking them for the service they had done him  he counted out ten bright guineas upon a table  and pushed them towards Brian  saying   I suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas was offered some weeks ago for the discovery of John Mac Dermod  one of the eight men whom we have just taken up   No  sir  said Brian   I did not know it  and I did not bring that note to you to get ten guineas  but because I thought it was right  I don  t want to be paid for doing it   That  s my own boy  said his father   We thank you  sir  but we  ll not take the money  I DON  T LIKE TO TAKE THE PRICE OF BLOOD   I know the difference  my good friends  said Mr  Somerville   between vile informers and courageous  honest men   Why  as to that  please your honour  though we are poor  I hope we are honest   And  what is more  said Mr  Somerville   I have a notion that you would continue to be honest  even if you were rich  Will you  my good lad  continued Mr  Somerville  after a moment  s pause  will you trust me with your pigeon a few days   O  and welcome  sir  said the boy  with a smile  and he brought the pigeon to Mr  Somerville when it was dark  and nobody saw him  A few days afterwards  Mr  Somerville called at O  Neill  s house  and bid him and his son follow him  They followed till he stopped opposite to the bow  window of the new inn  The carpenter had just put up a sign  which was covered over with a bit of carpeting   Go up the ladder  will you  said Mr  Somerville to Brian   and pull that sign straight  for it hangs quite crooked  There  now it is straight  Now pull off the carpet  and let us see the new sign  The boy pulled off the cover  and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign  and the name of O  Neill in large letters underneath   Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion  said Mr  Somerville  who saw that Brian  s surprise was too great for his situation   Come down from the ladder  and wish your father joy of being master of the new inn called the  White Pigeon  And I wish him joy of having such a son as you are  Those who bring up their children well  will certainly be rewarded for it  be they poor or rich  THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT   Mamma  said Rosamond  after a long silence   do you know what I have been thinking of all this time   No  my dear  What   Why  mamma  about my cousin Bell  s birthday  do you know what day it is   No  I don  t remember   Dear mother  don  t you remember it  s the nd of December  and her birthday is the day after to  morrow  Don  t you recollect now  But you never remember about birthdays  mamma  That was just what I was thinking of  that you never remember my sister Laura  s birthday  or  or  or MINE  mamma   What do you mean my dear  I remember your birthday perfectly well   Indeed  but you never KEEP it  though   What do you mean by keeping your birthday   Oh  mamma  you know very well  as Bell  s birthday is kept  In the first place  there is a great dinner   And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day   No  nor I should not mind about the dinner  except the mince  pies  But Bell has a great many nice things  I don  t mean nice eatable things  but nice new playthings  given to her always on her birthday  and everybody drinks her health  and she  s so happy   But stay  Rosamond  how you jumble things together  Is it everybody  s drinking her health that makes her so happy  or the new playthings  or the nice mince pies  I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is eating a mince pie  or whilst she is playing  but how does everybody  s drinking her health at dinner make her happy  Rosamond paused  and then said she did not know   But  added she   the NICE NEW playthings  mother   But why the nice new playthings  Do you like them only because they are NEW   Not ONLY  _I_ do not like playthings ONLY because they are new  but Bell DOES  I believe  for that puts me in mind  Do you know  mother  she had a great drawer full of OLD playthings that she never used  and she said that they were good for nothing  because they were OLD  but I thought many of them were good for a great deal more than the new ones  Now you shall be judge  mamma  I  ll tell you all that was in the drawer   Nay  Rosamond  thank you  not just now  I have not time to listen to you   Well then  mamma  the day after to  morrow I can show you the drawer  I want you to judge very much  because I am sure I was in the right  And  mother  added Rosamond  stopping her as she was going out of the room   will you  not now  but when you  ve time  will you tell me why you never keep my birthday  why you never make any difference between that day and any other day   And will you  Rosamond  not now  but when you have time to think about it  tell me why I should make any difference between your birthday and any other day  Rosamond thought  but she could not find out any reason  besides  she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer  for there was a certain work  basket to be finished  which she was making for her cousin Bell  as a present upon her birthday  The work was at a stand for want of some filigree  paper  and  as her mother was going out  she asked her to take her with her  that she might buy some  Her sister Laura went with them   Sister  said Rosamond  as they were walking along   what have you done with your half  guinea   I have it in my pocket   Dear  you will keep it for ever in your pocket  You know  my godmother when she gave it to you  said you would keep it longer than I should keep mine  and I know what she thought by her look at the time  I heard her say something to my mother   Yes  said Laura  smiling   she whispered so loud that I could not help hearing her too  She said I was a little miser   But did not you hear her say that I was very GENEROUS  and she  ll see that she was not mistaken  I hope she  ll be by when I give my basket to Bell  won  t it be beautiful  There is to be a wreath of myrtle  you know  round the handle  and a frost ground  and then the medallions   Stay  interrupted her sister  for Rosamond  anticipating the glories of her work  basket  talked and walked so fast that she had passed  without perceiving it  the shop where the filigree  paper was to be bought  They turned back  Now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street  and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane  A coach full of ladies stopped at the door  just before they went in  so that no one had time immediately to think of Rosamond and her filigree  paper  and she went to the window where she saw her sister Laura looking earnestly at something that was passing in the lane  Opposite to the window  at the door of a poor  looking house  there was sitting a little girl weaving lace  Her bobbins moved as quick as lightning  and she never once looked up from her work   Is not she very industrious  said Laura   and very honest  too  added she in a minute afterwards  for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his head passed  and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the little girl  She took it up eagerly  looked at it as if she was very hungry  then put aside her work  and ran after the baker to return it to him  Whilst she was gone  a footman in a livery  laced with silver  who belonged to the coach that stood at the shop door  as he was lounging with one of his companions  chanced to spy the weaving pillow  which she had left upon a stone before the door  To divert himself ( for idle people do mischief often to divert themselves ) he took up the pillow  and entangled all the bobbins  The little girl came back out of breath to her work  but what was her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled  She twisted and untwisted  placed and replaced  the bobbins  while the footman stood laughing at her distress  She got up gently  and was retiring into the house  when the silver laced footman stopped her  saying  insolently   Sit still  child   I must go to my mother  sir  said the child   besides  you have spoiled all my lace  I can  t stay   Can  t you  said the brutal footman  snatching her weaving  pillow again   I  ll teach you to complain of me  And he broke off  one after another  all the bobbins  put them into his pocket  rolled her weaving  pillow down the dirty lane  then jumped up behind his mistress  coach  and was out of sight in an instant   Poor girl  exclaimed Rosamond  no longer able to restrain her indignation at this injustice   poor little girl  At this instant her mother said to Rosamond  Come  now  my dear  if you want this filigree paper  buy it   Yes  madam  said Rosamond  and the idea of what her godmother and her cousin Bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her imagination  All her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed  Satisfied with bestowing another exclamation upon the  Poor little girl  she went to spend her half  guinea upon her filigree basket  In the meantime  she that was called the  little miser  beckoned to the poor girl  and  opening the window  said  pointing to the cushion   Is it quite spoiled   Quite  quite spoiled  and I can  t  nor mother neither  buy another  and I can  t do anything else for my bread  A few  but very few  tears fell as she said this   How much would another cost  said Laura   Oh  a great  GREAT deal   More than that  said Laura  holding up her half  guinea   Oh  no   Then you can buy another with that  said Laura  dropping the half  guinea into her hand  and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her  but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude  which gave Laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity  Late on the morning of her cousin  s birthday  Rosamond finished her work  basket  The carriage was at the door  Laura came running to call her  her father  s voice was heard at the same instant  so she was obliged to go down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper  a circumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted  for the pleasure of surprising Bell would be utterly lost if one bit of the filigree should peep out before the proper time  As the carriage went on  Rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other  and by each of the four corners   It will never do  my dear  said her father  who had been watching her operations   I am afraid you will never make a sheet of paper cover a box which is twice as large as itself   It is not a box  father  said Rosamond  a little peevishly   it  s a basket   Let us look at this basket  said he  taking it out of her unwilling hands  for she knew of what frail materials it was made  and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her father  s examination  He took hold of the handle rather roughly  when  starting off the coach seat  she cried   Oh  sir  father  sir  you will spoil it indeed  said she  with increased vehemence  when  after drawing aside the veil of silver paper  she saw him grasp the myrtle wreathed handle   Indeed  sir  you will spoil the poor handle   But what is the use of THE POOR HANDLE  said her father   if we are not to take hold of it  And pray  continued he  turning the basket round with his finger and thumb  rather in a disrespectful manner   pray  is this the thing you have been about all this week  I have seen you all this week dabbling with paste and rags  I could not conceive what you were about  Is this the thing   Yes  sir  You think  then  that I have wasted my time  because the basket is of no use  but then it is a present for my Cousin Bell   Your Cousin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is of no use  You had better have given her the purple jar   Oh  father  I thought you had forgotten that  it was two years ago  I  m not so silly now  But Bell will like the basket  I know  though it is of no use   Then you think Bell is sillier now than you were two years ago  well  perhaps that is true  but how comes it  Rosamond  now that you are so wise  that you are fond of such a silly person   _I_  father  said Rosamond  hesitating   I don  t think I am VERY fond of her   I did not say VERY fond   Well  but I don  t think I am at all fond of her   But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her   Yes  and all my half guinea besides   Yet you think her silly  and you are not fond of her at all  and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her   But it is her birthday  sir  and I am sure she will EXPECT something  and everybody else will give her something   Then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her something  And will you  or can you  or should you  always give  merely because others EXPECT  or because somebody else gives   Always  no  not always   Oh  only on birthdays  Rosamond  laughing   Now you are making a joke of me  papa  I see  but I thought you liked that people should be generous  my godmother said that she did   So do I  full as well as your godmother  but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous   Why is it not generous to make presents  said Rosamond   That is the question which it would take up a great deal of time to answer  But  for instance  to make a present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you neither love nor esteem  because it is her birthday  and because everybody gives her something  and because she expects something  and because your godmother says she likes that people should be generous  seems to me  my dear Rosamond  to be  since I must say it  rather more like folly than generosity  Rosamond looked down upon the basket  and was silent   Then I am a fool  am I  said she looking up at last   Because you have made ONE mistake  No  If you have sense enough to see your own mistakes  and can afterwards avoid them  you will never be a fool  Here the carriage stopped  and Rosamond recollected that the basket was uncovered  Now we must observe  that Rosamond  s father had not been too severe upon Bell when he called her a silly girl  From her infancy she had been humoured  and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled child  She was idle  fretful  and selfish  so that nothing could make her happy  On her birthday she expected  however  to be perfectly happy  Everybody in the house tried to please her  and they succeeded so well  that between breakfast and dinner she had only six fits of crying  The cause of five of these fits no one could discover  but the last  and most lamentable  was occasioned by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock  and accordingly  at dressing time  her maid brought it to her  exclaiming   See here  miss  what your mamma has sent you on your birthday  Here  s a frock fit for a queen  if it had but lace round the cuffs   And why has not it lace around the cuffs  mamma said it should   Yes  but mistress was disappointed about the lace  it is not come home   Not come home  indeed  and didn  t they know it was my birthday  But then I say I won  t wear it without the lace  I can  t wear it without the lace  and I won  t  The lace  however  could not be had  and Bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on   Come  Miss Bell  dry your eyes  said the maid who educated her   dry your eyes  and I  ll tell you something that will please you   What  then  said the child  pouting and sobbing   Why  but you must not tell that I told you   No  but if I am asked   Why  if you are asked  you must tell the truth  to be sure  So I  ll hold my tongue  miss   Nay  tell me  though  and I  ll never tell  if I AM asked   Well  then  said the maid   your cousin Rosamond is come  and has brought you the most BEAUTIFULLEST thing you ever saw in your life  but you are not to know anything about it till after dinner  because she wants to surprise you  and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till after dinner   Till after dinner  repeated Bell  impatiently   I can  t wait till then  I must see it this minute  The maid refused her several times  till Bell burst into another fit of crying  and the maid  fearing that her mistress would be angry with HER  if Bell  s eyes were red at dinner time  consented to show her the basket   How pretty  but let me have it in my own hands  said Bell  as the maid held the basket up out of her reach   Oh  no  you must not touch it  for if you should spoil it  what would become of me   Become of you  indeed  exclaimed the spoiled child  who never considered anything but her own immediate gratification  Become of YOU  indeed  what signifies that  I sha  n  t spoil it  and I will have it in my own hands  If you don  t hold it down for me directly  I  ll tell that you showed it to me   Then you won  t snatch it   No  no  I won  t indeed  said Bell  but she had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth  She snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach  A struggle ensued  in which the handle and lid were torn off  and one of the medallions crushed inwards  before the little fury returned to her senses  Calmed at this sight  the next question was  how she should conceal the mischief which she had done  After many attempts  the handle and lid were replaced  the basket was put exactly in the same spot in which it had stood before  and the maid charged the child   TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING WAS THE MATTER  We hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect  The habits of tyranny  meanness  and falsehood  which children acquire from living with bad servants  are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives  After shutting up the basket they left the room  and in the adjoining passage they found a poor girl waiting with a small parcel in her hand   What  s your business  said the maid   I have brought home the lace  madam  that was bespoke for the young lady   Oh  you have  have you  at last  said Bell   and pray why didn  t you bring it sooner  The girl was going to answer  but the maid interrupted her  saying  Come  come  none of your excuses  you are a little idle  good  for  nothing thing  to disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday  But now you have brought it  let us look at it  The little girl gave the lace without reply  and the maid desired her to go about her business  and not to expect to be paid  for that her mistress could not see anybody  BECAUSE she was in a room full of company   May I call again  madam  this afternoon  said the child  timidly   Lord bless my stars  replied the maid   what makes people so poor  I WONDERS  I wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse  as I told her  and not of these folks  Call again  yes  to be sure  I believe you  d call  call  call twenty times for twopence  However ungraciously the permission to call again was granted  it was received with gratitude  The little girl departed with a cheerful countenance  and Bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long wished  for lace upon her cuffs  Unfortunate Bell  All dinner time passed  and people were so hungry  so busy  or so stupid  that not an eye observed her favourite piece of finery  Till at length she was no longer able to conceal her impatience  and turning to Laura  who sat next to her  she said   You have no lace upon your cuffs  Look how beautiful mine is  is not it  Don  t you wish your mamma could afford to give some like it  But you can  t get any if she would  for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday  and nobody can get a bit more anywhere  if they would give the world for it   But cannot the person who made it  said Laura   make any more like it   No  no  no  cried Bell  for she had already learned  either from her maid or her mother  the mean pride which values things not for being really pretty or useful  but for being such as nobody else can procure   Nobody can get any like it  I say  repeated Bell   nobody in all London can make it but one person  and that person will never make a bit for anybody but me  I am sure  Mamma won  t let her  if I ask her not   Very well  said Laura  coolly   I do not want any of it  you need not be so violent  I assure you that I don  t want any of it   Yes  but you do  though  said Bell  more angrily   No  indeed  said Laura  smiling   You do  in the bottom of your heart  but you say you don  t to plague me  I know  cried Bell  swelling with disappointed vanity   It is pretty for all that  and it cost a great deal of money too  and nobody shall have any like it  if they cried their eyes out  Laura received this declaration in silence  Rosamond smiled  and at her smile the ill  suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her birthday   What  s the matter  my pet  cried her mother   come to me  and tell me what  s the matter  Bell ran roaring to her mother  but no otherwise explained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the fine lace with frantic gestures from her cuffs  and throwing the fragments into her mother  s lap   Oh  the lace  child  are you mad  said her mother  catching hold of both her hands   Your beautiful lace  my dear love  do you know how much it cost   I don  t care how much it cost  it is not beautiful  and I  ll have none of it  replied Bell  sobbing   for it is not beautiful   But it is beautiful  retorted her mother   I chose the pattern myself  Who has put it into your head  child  to dislike it  Was it Nancy   No  not Nancy  but THEM  mamma  said Bell  pointing to Laura and Rosamond   Oh  fie  don  t POINT  said her mother  putting down her stubborn finger   nor say THEM  like Nancy  I am sure you misunderstood  Miss Laura  I am sure  did not mean any such thing   No  madam  and I did not say any such thing  that I recollect  said Laura  gently   Oh  no  indeed  cried Rosamond  warmly  rising in her sister  s defence  No defence or explanation  however  was to be heard  for everybody had now gathered round Bell  to dry her tears  and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs  They succeeded so well  that in about a quarter of an hour the young lady  s eyes  and the reddened arches over her eyebrows came to their natural colour  and the business being thus happily hushed up  the mother  as a reward to her daughter for her good humour  begged that Rosamond would now be so good as to produce her  charming present  Rosamond  followed by all the company  amongst whom  to her great joy  was her godmother  proceeded to the dressing room   Now I am sure  thought she   Bell will be surprised  and my godmother will see she was right about my generosity  The doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony  and the filigree basket appeared in all its glory   Well  this is a charming present  indeed  said the godmother  who was one of the company   MY Rosamond knows how to make presents  And as she spoke  she took hold of the basket  to lift it down to the admiring audience  Scarcely had she touched it  when  lo  the basket fell to the ground  and only the handle remained in her hand  All eyes were fixed upon the wreck  Exclamations of sorrow were heard in various tones  and  Who can have done this  was all that Rosamond could say  Bell stood in sullen silence  which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the inquiries that were made about the disaster  At length the servants were summoned  and amongst them  Nancy  Miss Bell  s maid and governess  She affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket  and declared that she knew nothing of the matter  but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe  and that  for her part  she had never touched it  or thought of touching it  in her born days   Nor Miss Bell  neither  ma  am  I can answer for her  for she never knew of its being there  because I never so much as mentioned it to her  that there was such a thing in the house  because I knew Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret  so I never mentioned a sentence of it  did I  Miss Bell  Bell  putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught her  answered boldly   NO  but she had hold of Rosamond  s hand  and at the instant she uttered this falsehood she squeezed it terribly   Why do you squeeze my hand so  said Rosamond  in a low voice   what are you afraid of   Afraid of  cried Bell  turning angrily   I  m not afraid of anything  I  ve nothing to be afraid about   Nay  I did not say you had  whispered Rosamond   but only if you did by accident  you know what I mean  I should not be angry if you did  only say so   I say I did not  cried Bell  furiously   Mamma  mamma  Nancy  my cousin Rosamond won  t believe me  That  s very hard  It  s very rude  and I won  t bear it  I won  t   Don  t be angry  love  Don  t  said the maid   Nobody suspects you  darling  said her mother   but she has too much sensibility  Don  t cry  love  nobody suspected you  But you know  continued she  turning to the maid   somebody must have done this  and I must know how it was done  Miss Rosamond  s charming present must not be spoiled in this way  in my house  without my taking proper notice of it  I assure you I am very angry about it  Rosamond  Rosamond did not rejoice in her anger  and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughts  I WAS VERY FOOLISH  she began and stopped   Ma  am  cried the maid  suddenly   I  ll venture to say I know who did it   Who  said everyone  eagerly   Who  said Bell  trembling   Why  miss  don  t you recollect that little girl with the lace  that we saw peeping about in the passage  I  m sure she must have done it  for here she was by herself half an hour or more  and not another creature has been in mistress  dressing  room  to my certain knowledge  since morning  Those sort of people have so much curiosity  I  m sure she must have been meddling with it  added the maid   Oh  yes  that  s the thing  said the mistress  decidedly   Well  Miss Rosamond  for your comfort she shall never come into my house again   Oh  that would not comfort me at all  said Rosamond   besides  we are not sure that she did it  and if  A single knock at the door was heard at this instant  It was the little girl  who came to be paid for her lace   Call her in  said the lady of the house   let us see her directly  The maid  who was afraid that the girl  s innocence would appear if she were produced  hesitated  but upon her mistress repeating her commands  she was forced to obey  The girl came in with a look of simplicity  but when she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed  Rosamond and Laura looked at her and one another with surprise  for it was the same little girl whom they had seen weaving lace   Is not it she  whispered Rosamond to her sister   Yes  it is  but hush  said Laura   she does not know us  Don  t say a word  let us hear what she will say  Laura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke  so that the little girl could not see her   Vastly well  said Bell  s mother   I am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand there with that innocent look  Did you ever see that basket before   Yes  ma  am  said the girl   YES  MA  AM  cried the maid   and what else do you know about it  You had better confess it at once  and mistress  perhaps  will say no more about it   Yes  do confess it  added Bell  earnestly   Confess what  madam  said the little girl   I never touched the basket  madam   You never TOUCHED it  but you confess  interrupted Bell  s mother   that you DID SEE it before  And  pray  how came you to see it  You must have opened my wardrobe   No  indeed  ma  am  said the little girl   but I was waiting in the passage  ma  am  and this door was partly open  and looking at the maid  you know  I could not help seeing it   Why  how could you see through the doors of my wardrobe  rejoined the lady  The maid  frightened  pulled the little girl by the sleeve   Answer me  said the lady   where did you see this basket  Another stronger pull   I saw it  madam  in her hands  looking at the maid   and   Well  and what became of it afterwards   Ma  am  hesitating  miss pulled  and by accident  I believe  I saw  ma  am  miss  you know what I saw   I do not know  I do not know  and if I did  you had no business there  and mamma won  t believe you  I am sure  Everybody else  however  did believe  and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed   What do you all look at me so for  Why do you all look so  And am I to be put to shame on my birthday  cried she  bursting into a roar of passion   and all for this nasty thing  added she  pushing away the remains of the basket  and looking angrily at Rosamond   Bell  Bell  O  fie  fie  Now I am ashamed of you  that  s quite rude to your cousin  said her mother  who was more shocked at her daughter  s want of politeness than at her falsehood   Take her away  Nancy  till she has done crying  added she to the maid  who accordingly carried off her pupil  Rosamond  during this scene  especially at the moment when her present was pushed away with such disdain  had been making reflections upon the nature of true generosity  A smile from her father  who stood by  a silent spectator of the catastrophe of the filigree basket  gave rise to these reflections  nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence of the rest of the company  nor even by the praises of her godmother  who  for the purpose of condoling with her  said   Well  my dear Rosamond  I admire your generous spirit  You know I prophesied that your half  guinea would be gone the soonest  Did I not  Laura  said she  appealing  in a sarcastic tone  to where she thought Laura was   Where is Laura  I don  t see her  Laura came forward   You are too PRUDENT to throw away your money like your sister  Your half  guinea  I  ll answer for it  is snug in your pocket  Is it not   No  madam  answered she  in a low voice  But low as the voice of Laura was  the poor little lace  girl heard it  and now  for the first time  fixing her eyes upon Laura  recollected her benefactress   Oh  that  s the young lady  she exclaimed  in a tone of joyful gratitude   the good  good young lady  who gave me the half  guinea  and would not stay to be thanked for it  but I WILL thank her now   The half  guinea  Laura  said her godmother   What is all this   I  ll tell you  madam  if you please  said the little girl  It was not in expectation of being praised for it  that Laura had been generous  and therefore everybody was really touched with the history of the weaving  pillow  and whilst they praised  felt a certain degree of respect  which is not always felt by those who pour forth eulogiums  RESPECT is not an improper word  even applied to a child of Laura  s age  for let the age or situation of the person be what it may  they command respect who deserve it   Ah  madam  said Rosamond to her godmother   now you see  you see she is NOT a little miser  I  m sure that  s better than wasting half a guinea upon a filigree basket  is it not  ma  am  said she  with an eagerness which showed that she had forgotten all her own misfortunes in sympathy with her sister   This is being REALLY GENEROUS  father  is it not   Yes  Rosamond  said her father  and he kissed her   this IS being really generous  It is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity  it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves  and therefore  added he  smiling   it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others   The thing I like the best of all others  father  said Rosamond  half pleased  half vexed   What is that  I wonder  You don  t mean PRAISE  do you  sir   Nay  you must decide that yourself  Rosamond   Why  sir  said she  ingenuously   perhaps it WAS ONCE the thing I liked best  but the pleasure I have just felt makes me like something else much better  ETON MONTEM  [ Extracted from the  Courier  of May   ]  Yesterday this triennial ceremony took place  with which the public are too well acquainted to require a particular description  A collection  called Salt  is taken from the public  which forms a purse  to support the Captain of the School in his studies at Cambridge  This collection is made by the Scholars  dressed in fancy dresses  all round the country   At eleven o  clock  the youths being assembled in their habiliments at the College  the Royal Family set off from the Castle to see them  and  after walking round the Courtyard  they proceeded to Salt Hill in the following order   His Majesty  his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales  and the Earl of Uxbridge   Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Cumberland  Earl Morton  and General Gwynne  all on horseback  dressed in the Windsor uniform  except the Prince of Wales  who wore a suit of dark blue  and a brown surtout over   Then followed the Scholars  preceded by the Marechal Serjeant  the Musicians of the Staffordshire Band  and Mr  Ford  Captain of the Seminary  the Serjeant Major  Serjeants  Colonels  Corporals  Musicians  Ensign  Lieutenant  Steward  Salt Bearers  Polemen  and Runners   The cavalcade was brought up by her Majesty and her amiable daughters in two carriages  and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians  all eager to behold their Sovereign and his family  Among the former  Lady Lade was foremost in the throng  only two others dared venture their persons on horseback in such a multitude   The King and Royal Family were stopped on Eton Bridge by Messrs  Young and Mansfield  the Salt Bearers  to whom their Majesties delivered their customary donation of fifty guineas each   At Salt Hill  his Majesty  with his usual affability  took upon himself to arrange the procession round the Royal carriages  and even when the horses were taken off  with the assistance of the Duke of Kent  fastened the traces round the pole of the coaches  to prevent any inconvenience   An exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on  the Prince took leave  and went to the  Windmill Inn  till it subsided  The King and his attendants weathered it out in their great  coats   After the young gentlemen walked round the carriage  Ensign Vince and the Salt Bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill  but the wind being boisterous  he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag  and the space being too small before the carriages  from the concourse of spectators  the King kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such inconvenience   Their Majesties and the Princesses then returned home  the King occasionally stopping to converse with the Dean of Windsor  the Earl of Harrington  and other noblemen   The Scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the  Windmill Inn  and in the evening walked on Windsor Terrace   Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland  after taking leave of their Majesties  set off for town  and honoured the Opera House with their presence in the evening   The profit arising from the Salt collected  according to account  amounted to OO pounds   The Stadtholder  the Duke of Gordon  Lord and Lady Melbourne  Viscount Brome  and a numerous train of fashionable nobility  were present   The following is an account of their dresses  made as usual  very handsomely  by Mrs  Snow  milliner  of Windsor   Mr  Ford  Captain  with eight Gentlemen to attend him as servitors   Mr  Sarjeant  Marechal   Mr  Bradith  Colonel   Mr  Plumtree  Lieutenant   Mr  Vince  Ensign   Mr  Young  College Salt Bearer  white and gold dress  rich satin bag  covered with gold netting   Mr  Mansfield  Oppidan  white  purple  and orange dress  trimmed with silver  rich satin bag  purple and silver  each carrying elegant poles  with gold and silver cord   Mr  Keity  yellow and black velvet  helmet trimmed with silver   Mr  Bartelot  plain mantle and sandals  Scotch bonnet  a very Douglas   Mr  Knapp  flesh  colour and blue  Spanish hat and feathers   Mr  Ripley  rose  colour  helmet   Mr  Islip ( being in mourning ) a scarf  helmet  black velvet  and white satin   Mr  Tomkins  violet and silver  helmet   Mr  Thackery  lilac and silver  Roman Cap   Mr  Drury  mazarin blue  fancy cap   Mr  Davis  slate  colour and straw   Mr  Routh  pink and silver  Spanish hat   Mr  Curtis  purple  fancy cap   Mr  Lloyd  blue  ditto   At the conclusion of the ceremony the Royal Family returned to Windsor  and the boys were all sumptuously entertained at the tavern at Salt Hill  About six in the evening all the boys returned in the order of procession  and  marching round the great square of Eton  were dismissed  The captain then paid his respects to the Royal Family  at the Queen  s Lodge  Windsor  previously to his departure for King  s College  Cambridge  to defray which expense the produce of the Montem was presented to him   The day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty  rank  and fashion  on Windsor Terrace  enlivened by the performance of several bands of music   The origin of the procession is from the custom by which the Manor was held   The custom of hunting the Ram belonged to Eton College  as well as the custom of Salt  but it was discontinued by Dr  Cook  late Dean of Ely  Now this custom we know to have been entered on the register of the Royal Abbey of Bec  in Normandy  as one belonging to the Manor of East or Great Wrotham  in Norfolk  given by Ralph de Toni to the Abbey of Bec  and was as follows  When the harvest was finished the tenants were to have half an acre of barley  and a ram let loose  and if they caught him he was their own to make merry with  but if he escaped from them he was the Lord  s  The Etonians  in order to secure the ram  houghed him in the Irish fashion  and then attacked him with great clubs  The cruelty of this proceeding brought it into disuse  and now it exists no longer  See Register of the Royal Abbey of Bec  folio    After the dissolution of the alien priories  in   by the Parliament of Leicester  they remained in the Crown till Henry VI  who gave Wrotham Manor to Eton College  and if the Eton Fellows would search  they would perhaps find the Manor in their possession  that was held by the custom of Salt  MEN  Alderman Bursal  Father of young Bursal  Lord John  ) Talbot  ) Wheeler  ) Young

Landlord and Landlady  Landlady   Tis an unpossibility  Mr  Newington  and that  s enough  Say no more about it   tis an unpossibility in the natur of things  ( She ranges jellies  etc  in the Bar ) And pray  do you take your great old fashioned tankard  Mr  Newington  from among my jellies and confectioneries  Landlord ( takes his tankard and drinks ) Anything for a quiet life  If it is an impossibility  I  ve no more to say  only  for the soul of me  I can  t see the great unpossibility  wife  Landlady  Wife  indeed  wife  wife  wife every minute  Landlord  Heyday  Why  what a plague would you have me call you  The other day you quarrelled with me for calling you Mrs  Landlady  Landlady  To be sure I did  and very proper in me I should  I  ve turned off three waiters and five chambermaids already  for screaming after me Mrs  Landlady  Mrs  Landlady  But  tis all your ill manners  Landlord  Ill manners  Why  if I may be so bold  if you are not Mrs  Landlady  in the name of wonder what are you  Landlady  Mrs  Newington  Mr  Newington  Landlord ( drinks ) Mrs  Newington  Mr  Newington drinks your health  for I suppose I must not be landlord any more in my own house ( shrugs ) Landlady  Oh  as to that  I have no objections nor impediments to your being called LANDLORD  You look it  and become it very proper  Landlord  Why  yes  indeed  thank my tankard  I do look it  and become it  and am nowise ashamed of it  but everyone to their mind  as you  wife  don  t fancy the being called Mrs  Landlady  Landlady  To be sure I don  t  Why  when folks hear the old fashioned cry of Mrs  Landlady  Mrs  Landlady  who do they expect  think you  to see  but an overgrown  fat  featherbed of a woman  coming waddling along with her thumbs sticking on each side of her apron  o  this fashion  Now  to see me coming  nobody would take me to be a landlady  Landlord  Very true  indeed  wife  Mrs  Newington  I mean  I ask pardon  but now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of letting that old lady  and the civil  spoken young lady there above  have them there rooms for another day  Landlady  Now  Mr  Newington  let me hear no more about that old gentlewoman  and that civil  spoken young lady  Fair words cost nothing  and I  ve a notion that  s the cause they are so plenty with the young lady  Neither o  them  I take it  by what they  ve ordered since their coming into the house  are such grand folk  that one need be so petticular about them  Landlord  Why  they came only in a chaise and pair  to be sure  I can  t deny that  Landlady  But  bless my stars  what signifies talking  Don  t you know  as well as I do  Mr  Newington  that to  morrow is Eton Montem  and that if we had twenty times as many rooms and as many more to the back of them  it would not be one too many for all the company we  ve a right to expect  and those the highest quality of the land  Nay  what do I talk of to  morrow  isn  t my Lady Piercefield and suite expected  and  moreover  Mr  and Miss Bursal  s to be here  and will call for as much in an hour as your civil  spoken young lady in a twelvemonth  I reckon  So  Mr  Newington  if you don  t think proper to go up and inform the ladies above  that the Dolphin rooms are not for them  I must SPEAK myself  though  tis a thing I never do when I can help it  Landlord ( aside ) She not like to speak  ( Aloud ) My dear  you can speak a power better than I can  so take it all upon yourself  if you please  for  old  fashioned as I and my tankard here be  I can  t make a speech that borders on the uncivil order  to a lady like  for the life and lungs of me  So  in the name of goodness  do you go up  Mrs  Newington  Landlady  And so I will  Mr  Newington  Help ye  Civilities and rarities are out o  season for them that can  t pay for them in this world  and very proper  [ Exit Landlady ] Landlord  And very proper  Ha  who comes yonder  The Eton chap who wheedled me into lending him my best hunter last year  and was the ruination of him  but that must be paid for  wheedle or no wheedle  and  for the matter of wheedling  I  d stake this here Mr  Wheeler  that is making up to me  do you see  against e  er a boy  or hobbledehoy  in all Eton  London  or Christendom  let the other be who he will  Enter WHEELER  Wheeler  A fine day  Mr  Newington  Landlord  A fine day  Mr  Wheeler  Wheel  And I hope  for YOUR sake  we may have as fine a day for the Montem to  morrow  It will be a pretty penny in your pocket  Why  all the world will be here  and ( looking round at the jellies  etc ) so much the better for them  for here are good things enough  and enough for them  And here  s the best thing of all  the good old tankard still  not empty  I hope  Landlord  Not empty  I hope  Here  s to you  Mr  Wheeler  Wheel  Mr  Wheeler  CAPTAIN Wheeler  if you please  Landlord  YOU  Captain Wheeler  Why  I thought in former times it was always the oldest scholar at Eton that was Captain at the Montems  and didn  t Mr  Talbot come afore you  Wheel  Not at all  we came on the same day  Some say I came first  some say Talbot  So the choice of which of us is to be captain is to be put to the vote amongst the lads  most votes carry it  and I have most votes  I fancy  so I shall be captain  to  morrow  and a pretty deal of salt  I reckon I shall pocket  Why  the collection at the last Montem  they say  came to a plump thousand  No bad thing for a young fellow to set out with for Oxford or Cambridge  hey   Salt  the cant name given by the Eton lads to the money collected at Montem  Landlord  And no bad thing  before he sets out for Cambridge or Oxford   twould be for a young gentleman to pay his debts  Wheel  Debts  Oh  time enough for that  I  ve a little account with you in horses  I know  but that  s between you and me  you know  mum  Landlord  Mum me no mums  Mr  Wheeler  Between you and me  my best hunter has been ruinationed  and I can  t afford to be mum  So you  ll take no offence if I speak  and as you  ll set off to  morrow  as soon as the Montem  s over  you  ll be pleased to settle with me some way or other to  day  as we  ve no other time  Wheel  No time so proper  certainly  Where  s the little account  I have money sent me for my Montem dress  and I can squeeze that much out of it  I came home from Eton on purpose to settle with you  But as to the hunter  you must call upon Talbot  do you understand  to pay for him  for though Talbot and I had him the same day   twas Talbot did for him  and Talbot must pay  I spoke to him about it  and charged him to remember you  for I never forget to speak a good word for my friends  Landlord  So I perceive  Wheel  I  ll make bold just to give you my opinion of these jellies whilst you are getting my account  Mr  Newington  ( He swallows down a jelly or two  Landlord is going ) Enter TALBOT  Talbot  Hallo  Landlord  where are making off so fast  Here  your jellies are all going as fast as yourself  Wheel  ( aside ) Talbot  I wish I was a hundred miles off  Landlord  You are heartily welcome  Mr  Talbot  A good morning to you  sir  I  m glad to see you  very glad to see you  Mr  Talbot  Talb  Then shake hands  my honest landlord  ( Talbot  in shaking hands with him  puts a purse into the landlord  s hands ) Landlord  What  s here  Guineas  Talb  The hunter  you know  since Wheeler won  t

 my watch must go  Landlord  Nay  nay  but you are in such a hurry to pay  you won  t hear a man  Half this is enough for your share o  the mischief  in all conscience  Mr  Wheeler  there  had the horse on the same day  Wheel  But Bursal  s my witness  Talb  Oh  say no more about witnesses  a man  s conscience is always his best witness  or his worst  Landlord  take your money  and no more words  Wheel  This is very genteel of you  Talbot  I always thought you would do the genteel thing as I knew you to be so generous and considerate  Talb  Don  t waste your fine speeches  Wheeler  I advise you  this election time  Keep them for Bursal or Lord John  or some of those who like them  They won  t go down with me  Good morning to you  I give you notice  I  m going back to Eton as fast as I can gallop  and who knows what plain speaking may do with the Eton lads  I may be captain yet  Wheeler  Have a care  Is my horse ready there  Landlord  Mr  Talbot  s horse  there  Mr  Talbot  s horse  I say  Talbot sings   He carries weight  he rides a race   Tis for a thousand pound  ( Exit Talbot ) Wheel  And  dear me  I shall be left behind  A horse for me  pray  a horse for Mr  Wheeler  ( Exit Wheeler ) Landlord ( calls very loud ) Mr  Talbot  s horse  Hang the hostler  I  ll saddle him myself  ( Exit Landlord ) SCENE II  A Dining room in the Inn at Salt Hill  MRS  TALBOT and LOUISA  Louisa ( laughing ) With what an air Mrs  Landlady made her exit  Mrs  Talbot  When I was young  they say  I was proud  but I am humble enough now  these petty mortifications do not vex me  Louisa  It is well my brother was gone before Mrs  Landlady made her entree  for if he had heard her rude speech  he would at least have given her the retort courteous  Mrs  Talb  Now tell me honestly  my Louisa  You were  a few days ago  at Bursal House  Since you have left it and have felt something of the difference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour  you have never regretted that you did not stay there  and that you did not bear more patiently with Miss Bursal  s little airs  Louisa  Never for a moment  At first Miss Bursal paid me a vast deal of attention  but  for what reason I know not  she suddenly changed her manner  grew first strangely cold  then condescendingly familiar  and at last downright rude  I could not guess the cause of these variations  Mrs  Talb  ( aside ) I guess the cause too well  Louisa  But as I perceived the lady was out of tune  I was in haste to leave her  I should make a very bad  and  I am sure  a miserable toad eater  I had much rather  if I were obliged to choose  earn my own bread  than live as toad eater with anybody  Mrs  Talb  Fine talking  dear Louisa  Louisa  Don  t you believe me to be in earnest  mother  To be sure  you cannot know what I would do  unless I were put to the trial  Mrs  Talb  Nor you either  my dear  ( She sighs  and is silent ) Louisa ( takes her mother  s hand ) What is the matter  dear mother  You used to say  that seeing my brother always made you feel ten years younger  yet even while he was here  you had  in spite of all your efforts to conceal them  those sudden fits of sadness  Mrs  Talb  The Montem  is not it to  morrow  Ay  but my boy is not sure of being captain  Louisa  No  there is one Wheeler  who  as he says  is most likely to be chosen captain  He has taken prodigious pains to flatter and win over many to his interest  My brother does not so much care about it  he is not avaricious  Mrs  Talb  I love your generous spirit and his  but  alas  my dear  people may live to want  and wish for money  without being avaricious  I would not say a word to Talbot  full of spirits as he was this morning  I would not say a word to him  till after the Montem  of what has happened  Louisa  And what has happened  dear mother  Sit down  you tremble  Mrs  Talb  ( sits down and puts a letter into Louisa  s hand ) Read that  love  A messenger brought me that from town a few hours ago  Louisa ( reads )  By an express from Portsmouth  we hear the Bombay Castle East Indiaman is lost  with all your fortune on board  ALL  I hope there is something left for you to live upon  Mrs  Talb  About O pounds a year for us all  Louisa  That is enough  is it not  for YOU  Mrs  Talb  For me  love  I am an old woman  and want but little in this world  and shall be soon out of it  Louisa ( kneels down beside her ) Do not speak so  dearest mother  Mrs  Talb  Enough for me  love  Yes  enough  and too much for me  I am not thinking of myself  Louisa  Then  as to my brother  he has such abilities  and such industry  he will make a fortune at the bar for himself  most certainly  Mrs  Talb  But his education is not completed  How shall we provide him with money at Cambridge  Louisa  This Montem  The last time the captain had eight hundred  the time before a thousand  pounds  Oh  I hope  I fear  Now  indeed  I know that  without being avaricious  we may want  and wish for money  ( Landlady  s voice heard behind the scenes ) Landlady  Waiter  Miss Bursal  s curricle  and Mr  Bursal  s vis  a  vis  Run  see that the Dolphin  s empty  I say run  run  Mrs  Talb  I will rest for a few moments upon the sofa  in this bedchamber  before we set off  Louisa ( goes to open the door ) They have bolted or locked it  How unlucky  ( She turns the key  and tries to unlock the door ) Enter WAITER  Waiter  Ladies  I  m sorry  Miss Bursal and Mr  Bursal are come  just coming upstairs  Mrs  Talb  Then  will you be so good  sir  as to unlock this door  ( Waiter tries to unlock the door ) Waiter  It must be bolted on the inside  Chambermaid  Sally  Are you within there  Unbolt this door  Mr  Bursal  s voice behind the scenes  Mr  Burs  Let me have a basin of good soup directly  Waiter  I  ll go round and have the door unbolted immediately  ladies  ( Exit Waiter ) Enter MISS BURSAL  in a riding dress  and with a long whip  Miss Bursal  Those creatures  the ponies  have a  most pulled my  and off  Who  ave we  ere  Ha  Mrs  Talbot  Louisa   ow are ye  I  m so vastly glad to see you  but I  m so shocked to  ear of the loss of the Bombay Castle  Mrs  Talbot  you look but poorly  but this Montem will put everybody in spirits  I  ear everybody  s to be  ere  and my brother tells me   twill be the finest ever seen at HEton  Louisa  my dear  I  m sorry I  ve not a seat for you in my curricle for to  morrow  but I  ve promised Lady Betty  so  you know   tis impossible for me  Louisa  Certainly  and it would be impossible for me to leave my mother at present  Chambermaid ( opens the bedchamber door ) The room  s ready now  ladies  Mrs  Talb  Miss Bursal  we intrude upon you no longer  Miss Burs  Nay  why do you decamp  Mrs  Talbot  I  ad a thousand things to say to you  Louisa  but am so tired and so annoyed  ( Seats herself  Exeunt Mrs  Talbot  Louisa and Chambermaid ) Enter MR  BURSAL  with a basin of soup in his hand  Mr  Burs  Well  thank my stars the Airly Castle is safe in the Downs  Miss Burs  Mr  Bursal  can you inform me why Joe  my groom  does not make his appearance  Mr  Burs  ( eating and speaking ) Yes  that I can  child  because he is with his  orses  where he ought to be   Tis fit they should be looked after well  for they cost me a pretty penny  more than their heads are worth  and yours into the bargain  but I was resolved  as we were to come to this Montem  to come in style  Miss Burs  In style  to be sure  for all the world  s to be here  the King  the Prince of WHales  and Duke o  York  and all the first people  and we shall cut a dash  Dash  dash  will be the word to  morrow  ( playing with her whip ) Mr  Burs  ( aside ) Dash  dash  ay  just like her brother  He  ll pay away finely  I warrant  by the time he  s her age  Well  well  he can afford it  and I do love to see my children make a figure for their money  As Jack Bursal says  what  s money for  if it e  nt to make a figure  ( Aloud ) There  s your  brother Jack  now  The extravagant dog  he  ll have such a dress as never was seen  I suppose  at this here Montem  Why  now  Jack Bursal spends more money at Eton  and has more to spend  than my Lord John  though my Lord John  s the son of a marchioness  Miss Burs  Oh  that makes no difference nowadays  I wonder whether her ladyship is to be at this Montem  The only good I ever got out of these stupid Talbots was an introduction to their friend Lady Piercefield  What she could find to like in the Talbots  heaven knows  I  ve a notion she  ll drop them  when she hears of the loss of the Bombay Castle  Enter a WAITER  with a note  Waiter  A note from my Lady Piercefield  sir  Miss B  Charming woman  Is she here  pray  sir  Waiter  Just come  Yes  ma  am  ( Exit Waiter ) Miss B  Well  Mr  Bursal  what is it  Mr  B  ( reads )  Business of importance to communicate  Hum  what can it be ( going ) Miss B  ( aside ) Perhaps some match to propose for me  ( Aloud ) Mr  Bursal  pray before you go to her ladyship  do send my OOMAN to me to make me presentable  ( Exit Miss Bursal at one door ) Mr  B  ( at the opposite door )  Business of importance  Hum  I  m glad I  m prepared with a good basin of soup  There  s no doing business well upon an empty stomach  Perhaps the business is to lend cash  and I  ve no great stomach for that  But it will be an honour  to be sure  ( Exit ) SCENE III  Landlady  s Parlour  LANDLADY  MR  FINSBURY  a man  milliner  with bandboxes  a fancy cap  or helmet  with feathers  in the Landlady  s hand  a satin bag  covered with gold netting  in the man  milliner  s hand  a mantle hanging over his arm  A rough looking Farmer is sitting with his back towards them  eating bread and cheese  and reading a newspaper  Landlady  Well  this  to be sure  will be the best dressed Montem that ever was seen at Eton  and you Lon  on gentlemen have the most fashionablest notions  and this is the most elegantest fancy cap  Finsbury  Why  as you observe  ma  m  that is the most elegant fancy cap of them all  That is Mr  Hector Hogmorton  s fancy cap  ma  m  and here  ma  m  is Mr  Saul  s rich satin bag  covered with gold net  He is college salt bearer  I understand  and has a prodigious superb white and gold dress  But  in my humble opinion  ma  m  the marshal  s white and purple and orange fancy dress  trimmed with silver  will bear the bell  though  indeed  I shouldn  t say that  for the colonel  s and lieutenant  s  and ensign  s  are beautiful in the extreme  And  to be sure  nothing could be better imagined than Mr  Marlborough  s lilac and silver  with a Roman cap  And it must be allowed that nothing in nature can have a better effect than Mr  Drake  s flesh  colour and blue  with this Spanish hat  ma  m  you see  ( The farmer looks over his shoulder from time to time during this speech  with contempt ) Farmer ( reads the newspaper ) French fleet at sea  Hum  Landlady  O gemini  Mr  Drake  s Spanish hat is the sweetest  tastiest thing  Mr  Finsbury  I protest  Finsb  Why  ma  m  I knew a lady of your taste couldn  t but approve of it  My own invention entirely  ma  m  But it  s nothing to the captain  s cap  ma  m  Indeed  ma  m  Mr  Wheeler  the captain that is to be  has the prettiest taste in dress  To be sure  his sandals were my suggestion  but the mantle he has the entire credit of  to do him justice  and when you see it  ma  m  you will be really surprised  for ( for contrast  and elegance  and richness  and lightness  and propriety  and effect  and costume ) you  ve never yet seen anything at all to be compared to Captain Wheeler  s mantle  ma  m  Farmer ( to the Landlady ) Why  now  pray  Mrs  Landlady  how long may it have been the fashion for milliners to go about in men  s clothes  Landlady ( aside to Farmer ) Lord  Mr  Hearty  hush  This is Mr  Finsbury  the great man  milliner  Farm  The great man  milliner  This is a sight I never thought to see in Old England  Finsb  ( packing up band boxes ) Well  ma  m  I  m glad I have your approbation  It has ever been my study to please the ladies  Farm  ( throws a fancy mantle over his frieze coat ) And is this the way to please the ladies  Mrs  Landlady  nowadays  Finsb  ( taking off the mantle ) Sir  with your leave  I ask pardon  but the least thing detriments these tender colours  and as you have just been eating cheese with your hands  Farm   Tis my way to eat cheese with my mouth  man  Finsb  MAN  Farm  I ask pardon  man  milliner  I mean  Enter LANDLORD  Landlord  Why  wife  Landlady  Wife  Landlord  I ask pardon  Mrs  Newington  I mean  Do you know who them ladies are that you have been and turned out of the Dolphin  Landlady ( alarmed ) Not I  indeed  Who are they  pray  Why  if they are quality it  s no fault of mine  It is their own fault for coming  like scrubs  without four horses  Why  if quality will travel the road this way  incognito  how can they expect to be known and treated as quality   Tis no fault of mine  Why didn  t you find out sooner who they were  Mr  Newington  What else  in the  versal world have you to do  but to go basking about in the yards and places with your tankard in your hand  from morning till night  What have you else to ruminate  all day long  but to find out who  s who  I say  Farm  Clapper  clapper  clapper  like my mill in a high wind  landlord  Clapper  clapper  clapper  enough to stun a body  Landlord  That is not used to it  but use is all  they say  Landlady  Will you answer me  Mr  Newington  Who are the grandees that were in the Dolphin  and what  s become on them  Landlord  Grandees was your own word  wife  They be not to call grandees  but I reckon you  d be sorry not to treat  em civil  when I tell you their name is Talbot  mother and sister to our young Talbot  of Eton  he that paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning  Landlady  Mercy  is that all  What a combustion for nothing in life  Finsb  For nothing in life  as you say  ma  m  that is  nothing in high life  I  m sure  ma  m  nay  I dare a  most venture to swear  Would you believe it  Mr  Talbot is one of the few young gentlemen of Eton that has not bespoke from me a fancy dress for this grand Montem  Landlady  There  Mr  Newington  there  s your Talbot for you  and there  s your grandees  O trust me  I know your scrubs at first sight  Landlord  Scrubs  I don  t  nor can  t  nor won  t call them that pay their debts honestly  Scrubs  I don  t  nor won  t  nor can  t  call them that behave as handsome as young Mr  Talbot did here to me this morning about the hunter  A scrub he is not  wife  Fancy  dress or no fancy  dress  Mr  Finsbury  this young gentleman is no scrub  Finsb  Dear me   Twas not I said SCRUB  Did I say scrub  Farm  No matter if you did  Finsb  No matter  certainly  and yet it is a matter  for I  m confident I wouldn  t for the world leave it in anyone  s power to say that I said  that I called  any young gentleman of Eton a SCRUB  Why  you know  sir  it might breed a riot  Farm  And a pretty figure you  d make in a riot  Landlady  Pray let me hear nothing about riots in my house  Farm  Nor about scrubs  Finsb  But I beg leave to explain  gentlemen  All I ventured to remark or suggest was  that as there was some talk of Mr  Talbot  s being captain to  morrow  I didn  t conceive how he could well appear without any dress  That was all  upon my word and honour  A good morning to you  gentlemen  it is time for me to be off  Mrs  Newington  you were so obliging as to promise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as Eton  ( Finsbury bows and exit ) Farm  A good day to you and your bandboxes  There  s a fellow for you now  Ha  ha  ha  A man  milliner  forsooth  Landlord  Mrs  Talbot  s coming  stand back  Landlady  Lord  why does Bob show them through this way  Enter MRS  TALBOT  leaning on LOUISA  Waiter showing the way  Landlady  You are going on  I suppose  ma  am  Waiter ( aside to Landlord ) Not if she could help it  but there  s no beds  since Mr  Bursal and Miss Bursal  s come  Landlord  I say nothing  for it is vain to say more  But isn  t it a pity she can  t stay for the Montem  poor old lady  Her son  as good and fine a lad as ever you saw  they say  has a chance  too  of being captain  She may never live to see another such a sight  ( As Mrs  Talbot walks slowly on  the Farmer puts himself across her way  so as to stop her short ) Farm  No offence  madam  I hope  but I have a good snug farm house  not far off hand  and if so be you  d be so good to take a night  s lodging  you and the young lady with you  you  d have a hearty welcome  That  s all I can say and you  d make my wife very happy  for she  s a good woman  to say nothing of myself  Landlord  If I may be so bold to put in my word  madam  you  d have as good beds  and be as well lodged  with Farmer Hearty  as in e  er a house at Salt Hill  Mrs  Talb  I am very much obliged  Farm  O  say nothing o  that  madam  I am sure I shall be as much obliged if you do come  Do  miss  speak for me  Louisa  Pray  dear mother  Farm  She will  ( Calls behind the scenes ) Here  waiter  hostler  driver  what  s your name  drive the chaise up here to the door  smart  close  Lean on my arm  madam  and we  ll have you in and home in a whiff  ( Exeunt Mrs  Talbot  Louisa  Farmer  Landlord and Waiter ) Landlady ( sola ) What a noise and a rout this farmer man makes  and my husband  with his great broad face  bowing  as great a nincompoop as t  other  The folks are all bewitched with the old woman  I verily believe  ( Aloud ) A good morning to you  ladies  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE I  A field near Eton College  several boys crossing backwards and forwards in the back  ground  In front  TALBOT  WHEELER  LORD JOHN and BURSAL  Talbot  Fair play  Wheeler  Have at  em  my boy  There they stand  fair game  There  s Bursal there  with his dead forty  five votes at command  and Lord John with his  how many live friends  Lord John ( coolly ) Sir  I have fifty  six friends  I believe  Talb  Fifty  six friends  his lordship believes  Wheeler inclusive  no doubt  Lord J  That  s as hereafter may be  Wheeler  Hereafter  Oh  fie  my LUD  You know your own Wheeler has  from the first minute he ever saw you  been your fast friend  Talb  Your fast friend from the first minute he ever saw you  my lord  That  s well hit  Wheeler  stick to that  stick fast  Fifty  six friends  Wheeler INclusive  hey  my lord  hey  my LUD  Lord J  Talbot EXclusive  I find  contrary to my expectations  Talb  Ay  contrary to your expectations  you find that Talbot is not a dog that will lick the dust  but then there  s enough of the true spaniel breed to be had for whistling for  hey  Wheeler  Bursal ( aside to Wheeler ) A pretty electioneerer  So much the better for you  Wheeler  Why  unless he bought a vote  he  d never win one  if he talked from this to the day of judgment  Wheeler ( aside to Bursal ) And as he has no money to buy votes  he  he  he  we are safe enough  Talb  That  s well done  Wheeler  fight the by  battle there with Bursal  Now you are sure of the main with Lord John  Lord J  Sure  I never made Mr  Wheeler any promise yet  Wheel  O  I ask no promise from his lordship  we are upon honour  I trust entirely to his lordship  s good nature and generosity  and to his regard for his own family  I having the honour  though distantly  to be related  Lord J  Related  How  Wheeler  Wheel  Connected  I mean  which is next door  as I may say  to being related  Related slipped out by mistake  I beg pardon  my Lord John  Lord J  Related  a strange mistake  Wheeler  Talb  Overshot yourself  Wheeler  overshot yourself  by all that  s awkward  And yet  till now  I always took you for  a dead  shot at a yellow  hammer   Young noblemen at Oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps  Hence their flatterers are said to be dead  shots at yellow  hammers  Wheel  ( taking Bursal by the arm ) Bursal  a word with you  ( Aside to Bursal ) What a lump of family pride that Lord John is  Talb  Keep out of my hearing  Wheeler  lest I should spoil sport  But never fear  you  ll please Bursal sooner than I shall  I can  t  for the soul of me  bring myself to say that Bursal  s not purse  proud  and you can  Give you joy  Burs  A choice electioneerer  ha  ha  ha  Wheel  ( faintly ) He  he  he  a choice electioneerer  as you say  ( Exeunt Wheeler and Bursal  manent Lord J  and Talbot ) Lord J  There was a time  Talbot  Talb  There was a time  my lord  to save trouble and a long explanation   there was a time when you liked Talbots better than spaniels  you understand me  Lord J  I have found it very difficult to understand you of late  Mr  Talbot  Talb  Yes  because you have used other people  s understandings instead of your own  Be yourself  my lord  See with your own eyes  and hear with your own ears  and then you  ll find me still  what I  ve been these seven years  not your understrapper  your hanger  on  your flatterer  but your friend  If you choose to have me for a friend  here  s my hand  I am your friend  and you  ll not find a better  Lord J  ( giving his hand ) You are a strange fellow  Talbot  I thought I never could have forgiven you for what you said last night  Talb  What  for I don  t keep a register of my sayings  Oh  it was something about gaming  Wheeler was flattering your taste for it  and he put me into a passion  I forget what I said  But  whatever it was  I  m sure it was well meant  and I believe it was well said  Lord J  But you laugh at me sometimes to my face  Talb  Would you rather I should laugh at you behind your back  Lord  J  But of all things in the world I hate to be laughed at  Listen to me  and don  t fumble in your pockets while I  m talking to you  Talb  I  m fumbling for  oh  here it is  Now  Lord John  I once did laugh at you behind your back  and what  s droll enough  it was at your back I laughed  Here  s a caricature I drew of you  I really am sorry I did it  but  tis best to show it to you myself  Lord J  ( aside ) It is all I can do to forgive this  ( After a pause  he tears the paper ) I have heard of this caricature before  but I did not expect  Talbot  that you would come and show it to me  yourself  Talbot  so handsomely  especially at such a time as this  Wheeler might well say you are a bad electioneerer  Talb  Oh  hang it  I forgot my election  and your fifty  six friends  Enter RORY O  RYAN  Rory ( claps Talbot on the back ) Fifty  six friends  have you  Talbot  Say seven  fifty  seven  I mean  for I  ll lay you a wager  you  ve forget me  and that  s a shame for you  too  for out of the whole posse  comitatus entirely now  you have not a stauncher friend than Poor little Rory O  Ryan  And a good right he has to befriend you  for you stood by him when many who ought to have known better were hunting him down for a wild Irishman  Now that same wild Irishman has as much gratitude in him as any tame Englishman of them all  But don  t let  s be talking sintimint  for  for my share I  d not give a bogberry a bushel for sintimint  when I could get anything better  Lord J  And pray  sir  what may a bogberry be  Rory  Phoo  don  t be playing the innocent  now  Where have you lived all your life ( I ask pardon  my LARD ) not to know a bogberry when you see or hear of it  ( Turns to Talbot ) But what are ye standing idling here for  Sure  there  s Wheeler  and Bursal along with him  canvassing out yonder at a terrible fine rate  And haven  t I been huzzaing for you there till I  m hoarse  So I am  and just stepped away to suck an orange for my voice ( sucks an orange ) I am a THOROUGH GOING friend  at anyrate  Talb  Now  Rory  you are the best fellow in the world  and a THOROUGH GOING friend  but have a care  or you  ll get yourself and me into some scrape  before you have done with this violent THOROUGH GOING work  Rory  Never fear  never fear  man  a warm frind and a bitter enemy  that  s my maxim  Talb  Yes  but too warm a friend is as bad as a bitter enemy  Rory  Oh  never fear me  I  m as cool as a cucumber all the time  and whilst they tink I  m tinking of nothing in life but making a noise  I make my own snug little remarks in prose and verse  as  now my voice is after coming back to me  you shall hear  if you plase  Talb  I do please  Rory  I call it Rory  s song  Now  mind  I have a verse for everybody  o  the leading lads  I mean  and I shall put  em in or lave  em out  according to their inclinations and deserts  wise  a  wee to you  my little frind  So you comprehend it will be Rory  s song  with variations  Talbot and Lord John  Let  s have it  let  s have it without further preface  Rory sings   I  m true game to the last  and no WHEELER for me  Rory  There  s a stroke  in the first place  for Wheeler  you take it  Talb  O yes  yes  we take it  go on  Rory sings   I  m true game to the last  and no Wheeler for me  Of all birds  beasts  or fishes  that swim in the sea  Webb  d or finn  d  black or white  man or child  Whig or Tory  None but Talbot  O  Talbot  s the dog for Rory  Talb   Talbot the dog  is much obliged to you  Lord J  But if I have any ear  one of your lines is a foot too long  Mr  O  Ryan  Rory  Phoo  put the best foot foremost for a frind  Slur it in the singing  and don  t be quarrelling  anyhow  for a foot more or less  The more feet the better it will stand  you know  Only let me go on  and you  ll come to something that will plase you  Rory sings   Then there  s he with the purse that  s as long as my arm  Rory  That  s Bursal  mind now  whom I mean to allude to in this verse  Lord J  If the allusion  s good  we shall probably find out your meaning  Talb  On with you  Rory  and don  t read us notes on a song  Lord J  Go on  and let us hear what you say of Bursal  Rory sings   Then there  s he with the purse that  s as long as my arm  His father  s a tanner  but then where  s the harm  Heir to houses  and hunters  and horseponds in fee  Won  t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree  Lord J  Encore  encore  Why  Rory  I did not think you could make so good a song  Rory  Sure  twas none of I made it  twas Talbot here  Talb  I  Rory  ( aside ) Not a word  I  ll make you a present of it  sure  then  it  s your own  Talb  I never wrote a word of it  Rory  ( to Lord J ) Phoo  Phoo  he  s only denying it out of false modesty  Lord  J  Well  no matter who wrote it  sing it again  Rory  Be easy  so I will  and as many more verses as you will to the back of it  ( Winking at Talbot aside ) You shall have the credit of all  ( Aloud ) Put me in when I  m out  Talbot  and you ( to Lord John ) join  join  Rory sings  and Lord John sings with him   Then there  s he with the purse that  s as long as my arm  His father  s a tanner  but then where  s the harm  Heir to houses  and hunters  and horseponds in fee  Won  t his skins sure soon buy him a pedigree  There  s my lord with the back that never was bent  ( Lord John stops singing  Talbot makes signs to Rory to stop  but Rory does not see him  and sings on )  There  s my lord with the back that never was bent  Let him live with his ancestors  I am content  ( Rory pushes Lord J  and Talbot with his elbows ) Rory  Join  join  both of ye  why don  t you join  ( Sings )  Who  ll buy my Lord John  the arch fishwoman cried  A nice oyster shut up in a choice shell of pride  Rory  But join or ye spoil all  Talb  You have spoiled all  indeed  Lord J  ( making a formal low bow ) Mr  Talbot  Lord John thanks you  Rory  Lord John  blood and thunder  I forgot you were by  quite and clean  Lord J  ( puts him aside and continues speaking to Talbot ) Lord John thanks you  Mr  Talbot  this is the second part of the caricature  Lord John thanks you for these proofs of friendship  Lord John has reason to thank you  Mr  Talbot  Rory  No reason in life now  Don  t be thanking so much for nothing in life  or if you must be thanking of somebody  it  s me you ought to thank  Lord J  I ought and do  sir  for unmasking one who  Talb  ( warmly ) Unmasking  my lord  Rory ( holding them asunder ) Phoo  phoo  phoo  be easy  can  t ye  there  s no unmasking at all in the case  My Lord John  Talbot  s writing the song was all a mistake  Lord J  As much a mistake as your singing it  sir  I presume  Rory  Just as much   Twas all a mistake  So now don  t you go and make a mistake into a misunderstanding  It was I made every word of the song out o  the face  that about the back that never was bent  and the ancestors of the oyster  and all  He did not waste a word of it  upon my conscience  I wrote it all  though I  ll engage you didn  t think I could write a good thing  ( Lord John turns away ) I  m telling you the truth  and not a word of a lie  and yet you won  t believe me   From beginning to end  Lord J  You will excuse me  sir  if I cannot believe two contradictory assertions within two minutes  Mr  Talbot  I thank you ( going ) ( Rory tries to stop Lord John from going  but cannot  Exit Lord John ) Rory  Well  if he WILL go  let him go then  and much good may it do him  Nay  but don  t you go too  Talb  O Rory  what have you done ( Talbot runs after Lord J ) Hear me  my lord  ( Exit Talbot ) Rory  Hear him  hear him  hear him  Well  I  m point blank mad with myself for making this blunder  but how could I help it  As sure as ever I am meaning to do the best thing on earth  it turns out the worst  Enter a party of lads  huzzaing  Rory ( joins ) Huzza  huzza  Who  pray  are

ears  ( Several speak at once ) And I heard him  and I  and I  and I  Huzza  Wheeler for ever  Rory  Oh  murder  murder  murder  ( Aside ) This goes to my heart  it  s all my doing  O  my poor Talbot

that huzzaing for Talbot  ( Rory behind the scenes   Huzza for Talbot  Talbot for ever  huzza ) Burs  Pooh  it is only Rory O  Ryan  or the roaring lion as I call him  Ha  ha  ha  Rory O  Ryan  alias O  Ryan  the roaring lion  that  s a good one  put it about  Rory O  Ryan  the roaring lion  ha  ha  ha  but you don  t take it  you don  t laugh  Wheeler  Wheeler  Ha  ha  ha  O  upon my honour I do laugh  ha  ha  ha  ( Aside ) It is the hardest work to laugh at his wit  ( Aloud ) Rory O  Ryan  the roaring lion  ha  ha  ha  You know I always laugh  Bursal  at your jokes  he  he  he  ready to kill myself  Burs  ( sullenly ) You are easily killed  then  if that much laughing will do the business  Wheel  ( coughing ) Just then  something stuck in my throat  I beg your pardon  Burs  ( still sullen ) Oh  you need not beg my pardon about the matter  I don  t care whether you laugh or no  not I  Now you have got Lord John to declare for you  you are above laughing at my jokes  I suppose  Wheel  No  upon my word and honour  I DID laugh  Burs  ( aside ) A fig for your word and honour  ( Aloud ) I know I  m of no consequence now  but you  ll remember  that if his lordship has the honour of making you captain  he must have the honour to pay for your captain  s accoutrements  for I sha  n  t pay the piper  I promise you  since I  m of no consequence  Wheel  Of no consequence  But  my dear Bursal  what could put that into your head  that  s the strangest  oddest fancy  Of no consequence  Bursal  of no consequence  Why  everybody that knows anything  everybody that has seen Bursal House  knows that you are of the greatest consequence  my dear Bursal  Burs  ( taking out his watch  and opening it  looks at it ) No  I  m of no consequence  I wonder that rascal Finsbury is not come yet with the dresses ( still looking at his watch ) Wheel  ( aside ) If Bursal takes it into his head not to lend me the money to pay for my captain  s dress  what will become of me  for I have not a shilling  and Lord John won  t pay for me  and Finsbury has orders not to leave the house till he is paid by everybody  What will become of me ( bites his nails ) Burs  ( aside ) How I love to make him bite his nails  ( Aloud ) I know I  m of no consequence  ( Strikes his repeater ) Wheel  What a fine repeater that is of yours  Bursal  It is the best I ever heard  Burs  So it well may be  for it cost a mint of money  Wheel  No matter to you what anything costs  Happy dog as you are  You roll in money  and yet you talk of being of no consequence  Burs  But I am not of half so much consequence as Lord John  am I  Wheel  Are you  Why  aren  t you twice as rich as he  Burs  Very true  but I  m not purse  proud  Wheel  You purse  proud  I should never have thought of such a thing  Burs  Nor I  if Talbot had not used the word  Wheel  But Talbot thinks everybody purse  proud that has a purse  Burs  ( aside ) Well  this Wheeler does put one into a good humour with one  s self in spite of one  s teeth  ( Aloud ) Talbot says blunt things  but I don  t think he  s what you can call clever  hey  Wheeler  Wheel  Clever  Oh  not he  Burs  I think I could walk round him  Wheel  To be sure you could  Why  do you know  I  ve quizzed him famously myself within this quarter of an hour  Burs  Indeed  I wish I had been by  Wheel  So do I   faith  It was the best thing  I wanted  you see  to get him out of my way  that I might have the field clear for electioneering to  day  So I bowls up to him with a long face  such a face as this  Mr  Talbot  do you know  I  m sorry to tell you  here  s Jack Smith has just brought the news from Salt Hill  Your mother  in getting into the carriage  slipped  and has BROKE her leg  and there she  s lying at a farmhouse  two miles off  Is not it true  Jack  said I  I saw the farmer helping her in with my own eyes  cries Jack  Off goes Talbot like an arrow  Quizzed him  quizzed him  said I  Burs  Ha  ha  ha  quizzed him indeed  with all his cleverness  that was famously done  Wheel  Ha  ha  ha  With all his cleverness he will be all the evening hunting for the farmhouse and the mother that has broke her leg  so he is out of our way  Burs  But what need have you to want him out of your way  now Lord John has come over to your side  You have the thing at a dead beat  Wheel  Not so dead either  for there  s a great independent party  you know  and if YOU don  t help me  Bursal  to canvass them  I shall be no captain  It is you I depend upon after all  Will you come and canvass them with me  Dear Bursal  pray  all depends upon you  ( Pulls him by the arm  Bursal follows ) Burs  Well  if all depends upon me  I  ll see what I can do for you  ( Aside ) Then I am of some consequence  Money makes a man of some consequence  I see  at least with some folks  SCENE II  In the back scene a flock of sheep are seen penned  In front  a party of country lads and lasses  gaily dressed  as in sheep  shearing time  with ribands and garlands of flowers  etc

here comes Patty  Here comes the Queen o  the day  What has kept you from us so long  Patty  nd Peasant   Please your Majesty  you should say  Patty  This poor little lamb of mine was what kept me so long  It strayed away from the rest  and I should have lost him  so I should  for ever  if it had not been for a good young gentleman  Yonder he is  talking to Farmer Hearty  That  s the young gentleman who pulled my lamb out of the ditch for me  into which he had fallen  pretty creature  st Peasant  Pretty creature  or  your Majesty  whichever you choose to be called  come and dance with them  and I  ll carry your lamb  ( Exeunt  singing and dancing ) Enter FARMER HEARTY and TALBOT  Farmer  Why  young gentleman  I  m glad I happened to light upon you here  and so to hinder you from going farther astray  and set your heart at ease like  Talb  Thanks  good farmer  you have set my heart at ease  indeed  But the truth is  they did frighten me confoundedly  more fool I  Farm  No fool at all  to my notion  I should  at your age  ay  or at my age  just the self  same way have been frightened myself  if so be that mention had been made to me  that way  of my own mother  s having broke her leg or so  And greater  by a great deal  the shame for them that frighted you  than for you to be frighted  How young gentlemen  now  can bring themselves for to tell such lies  is to me  now  a matter of amazement  like  that I can  t noways get over  Talb  Oh  farmer  such lies are very witty  though you and I don  t just now like the wit of them  This is fun  this is quizzing  but you don  t know what we young gentlemen mean by quizzing  Farm  Ay  but I do though  to my cost  ever since last year  Look you  now  at yon fine field of wheat  Well  it was just as fine  and finer  last year  till a young Eton jackanapes  Talb  Take care what you say  farmer  for I am a young Eton jackanapes  Farm  No  but you be not the young Eton jackanapes that I  m a  thinking on  I tell you it was this time last year  man  he was a  horseback  I tell ye  mounted upon a fine bay hunter  out a  hunting  like  Talb  I tell you it was this time last year  man  that I was mounted upon a fine bay hunter  out a  hunting  Farm  Zooks  would you argufy a man out of his wits  You won  t go for to tell me that you are that impertinent little jackanapes  Talb  No  no  I  ll not tell you that I am an impertinent little jackanapes  Farm ( wiping his forehead ) Well  don  t then  for I can  t believe it  and you put me out  Where was I  Talb  Mounted upon a fine bay hunter  Farm  Ay  so he was   Here  YOU  says he  meaning me  open this gate for me  Now  if he had but a  spoke me fair  I would not have gainsaid him  but he falls to swearing  so I bid him open the gate for himself   There  s a bull behind you  farmer  says he  I turns   Quizzed him  cries my jackanapes  and off he gallops him  through the very thick of my corn  but he got a fall  leaping the ditch out yonder  which pacified me  like  at the minute  So I goes up to see whether he was killed  but he was not a whit the worse for his tumble  So I should ha  fell into a passion with him then  to be sure  about my corn  but his horse had got such a terrible sprain  I couldn  t say anything to him  for I was a  pitying the poor animal  As fine a hunter as ever you saw  I am sartain sure he could never come to good after  Talb  ( aside ) I do think  from the description  that this was Wheeler  and I have paid for the horse which he spoiled  ( Aloud ) Should you know either the man or the horse again  if you were to see them  Farm  Ay  that I should  to my dying day  Talb  Will you come with me  then  and you  ll do me some guineas  worth of service  Farm  Ay  that I will  with a deal of pleasure  for you be a civil spoken young gentleman  and  besides  I don  t think the worse on you for being FRIGHTED a little about your mother  being what I might ha  been  at your age  myself  for I had a mother myself once  So lead on  master  ( Exeunt ) END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT THE THIRD  SCENE I  The garden of the  Windmill Inn  at Salt Hill  MISS BURSAL  MRS  NEWINGTON  SALLY  the Chambermaid  ( Miss

to Salt Hill  you won  t leave us all at sixes and sevens  What can we do without you  Lord J  You can do very well without me  Bursal  You can do very well without me  Wheel  ( to Burs ) Impossible  impossible  You know Mr  Finsbury will be here just now  with the dresses  and we have to try them on  Burs  And to pay for them  Wheel  And to settle about the procession  And then  my lord  the election is to come on this evening  You won  t go till that  s over  as your lordship has PROMISED me your lordship  s vote and interest  Lord J  My vote I promised you  Mr  Wheeler  but I said not a syllable about my INTEREST  My friends  perhaps  have not been offended  though I have  by Mr  Talbot  I shall leave them to their own inclinations  Burs  ( whistling ) Wheugh  wheugh  wheugh  Wheeler  the principal  s nothing without the interest  Wheel  Oh  the interest will go along with the principal  of course  for I  m persuaded  if my lord leaves his friends to their inclinations  it will be the inclination of my lord  s friends to vote as he does  if he says nothing to them to the contrary  Lord J  I told you  Mr  Wheeler  that I should leave them to themselves  Burs  ( still whistling ) Well  I  ll do my best to make that father of mine send me off to Oxford  I  m sure I  m fit to go  along with Wheeler  Why  you  d best be my tutor  Wheeler  a devilish good thought  Wheel  An excellent thought  Burs  And a cursed fine dust we should kick up at Oxford  with your Montem money and all  Money  s THE GO after all  I wish it was come to my making you my last bow   ye distant spires  ye ANTIC towers  Wheel  ( aside to Lord J ) Ye ANTIC towers  fit for Oxford  my lord  Lord J  Antique towers  I suppose Mr  Bursal means  Burs  Antique  to be sure  I said antique  did not I  Wheeler  Wheel  O  yes  Lord J  ( aside ) What a mean animal is this  Enter RORY O  RYAN  Rory  Why  now  what  s become of Talbot  I want to know  There he is not to be found anywhere in the wide world  and there  s a hullabaloo amongst his friends for him  ( Wheeler and Bursal wink at one another ) Wheel  We know nothing of him  Lord J  I have not the honour  sir  to be one of Mr  Talbot  s friends  It is his own fault  and I am sorry for it  Rory   Faith  so am I  especially as it is mine  fault I mean  and especially as the election is just going to come on  Enter a party of boys  who cry  Finsbury  s come  Finsbury  s come with the dresses  Wheel  Finsbury  s come  Oh  let us see the dresses  and let us try  em on to  night  Burs  ( pushing the crowd ) On with ye  on with ye

By  and  by  I  ve a word in his ear  by your LAVE and his  Burs  Why  what the devil stops the way  there  Push on  on with them  th Boy  I  m marshal  Burs  On with you  on with you  who cares what you are  Wheel  ( to Bursal  aside ) You  ll pay Finsbury for me  you rich Jew  ( To Lord John ) Your lordship will remember your lordship  s promise  Lord J  I do not usually forget my promises  sir  and therefore need not to be reminded of them  Wheel  I beg pardon  I beg ten thousand pardons  my lord  Burs  ( taking him by the arm ) Come on  man  and don  t stand begging pardon there  or I  ll leave you  Wheel  ( to Burs ) I beg pardon  Bursal  I beg pardon  ten thousand times  ( Exeunt ) Manent LORD JOHN and RORY O  RYAN  Rory  Wheugh  Now put the case  If I was going to be hanged  for the life of me I couldn  t be after begging so many pardons for nothing at all  But many men  many minds ( Hums ) True game to the last  No Wheeler for me  Oh  murder  I forgot  I was nigh letting the cat out o  the bag again  Lord J  You had something to say to me  sir  I wait till your recollection returns  Rory   Faith  and that  s very kind of you  and if you had always done so  you would never have been offended with me  my lord  Lord J  You are mistaken  Mr  O  Ryan  if you think that you did or could offend me  Rory  Mistaken was I  then  sure enough  but we are all liable to mistakes  and should forget and forgive one another  that  s the way to go through  Lord J  You will go through the world your own way  Mr  O  Ryan  and allow me to go through it my way  Rory  Very fair  fair enough  then we shan  t cross  But now  to come to the point  I don  t like to be making disagreeable retrospects  if I could any way avoid it  nor to be going about the bush  especially at this time o  day  when  as Mr  Finsbury  s come  we  ve not so much time to lose as we had  Is there any truth  then  my lord  in the report that is going about this hour past  that you have gone in a huff  and given your promise there to that sneaking Wheeler to vote for him now  Lord J  In answer to your question  sir  I am to inform you that I HAVE promised Mr  Wheeler to vote for him  Rory  In a huff  Ay  now  there it is  Well  when a man  s MAD  to be sure  he  s mad  and that  s all that can be said about it  And I know  if I had been MAD myself  I might have done a foolish thing as well as another  But now  my lord  that you are not mad  Lord J  I protest  sir  I cannot understand you  In one word  sir  I  m neither mad nor a fool  Your most obedient ( going  angrily ) Rory ( holding him ) Take care now  you are going mad with me again  But phoo  I like you the better for being mad  I  m very often mad myself  and I would not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his life  Lord J  ( aside ) He  ll not be quiet  till he makes me knock him down  Rory  Agh  agh  agh  I begin to guess whereabouts I am at last  MAD  in your country  I take it  means fit for Bedlam  but with us in Ireland  now   tis no such thing  it mean  s nothing in life but the being in a passion  Well  one comfort is  my lord  as you  re a bit of a scholar  we have the Latin proverb in our favour  Ira furor brevis est  ( Anger is short madness ) The shorter the better  I think  So  my lord  to put an end to whatever of the kind you may have felt against poor Talbot  I  ll assure you he  s as innocent o  that unfortunate song as the babe unborn  Lord J  It is rather late for Mr  Talbot to make apologies to me  Rory  He make apologies  Not he   faith  he  d send me to Coventry  or  maybe  to a worse place  did he but know I was condescending to make this bit of explanation  unknown to him  But  upon my conscience  I  ve a regard for you both  and don  t like to see you go together by the ears  Now  look you  my lord  By this book  and all the books that were ever shut and opened  he never saw or heard of that unlucky song of mine till I came out with it this morning  Lord J  But you told me this morning that it was he who wrote it  Rory  For that I take shame to myself  as it turned out  but it was only a WHITE lie to SARVE a friend  and make him cut a dash with a new song at election time  But I  ve done for ever with white lies  Lord J  ( walking about as if agitated ) I wish you had never begun with them  Mr  O  Ryan  This may be a good joke to you  but it is none to me or Talbot  So Talbot never wrote a word of the song  Rory  Not a word or syllable  good or bad  Lord J  And I have given my promise to vote against him  He  ll lose his election  Rory  Not if you  ll give me leave to speak to your friends in your name  Lord J  I have promised to leave them to themselves  and Wheeler  I am sure  has engaged them by this time  Rory  Bless my body  I  ll not stay prating here then  ( Exit Rory ) Lord J  ( follows ) But what can have become of Talbot  I have been too hasty for once in my life  Well  I shall suffer for it more than anybody else  for I love Talbot  since he did not make the song  of which I hate to think  ( Exit ) SCENE III  A large hall in Eton College  A staircase at the end  Eton lads  dressed in their Montem Dresses in the Scene  In

But I thought Finsbury knew you too well to give you credit for anything  Fins  You are pleased to be pleasant  sir  Mr  Wheeler knows  in that sense of the word  it is out of my power to give him credit  and I  m sure he would not ask it  Wheel  ( aside ) O  Bursal  pay him  and I  ll pay you tomorrow  Burs  Now  if you weren  t to be captain after all  Wheeler  what a pretty figure you  d cut  Ha  ha  ha  Hey  Wheel  Oh  I am as sure of being captain as of being alive  ( Aside ) Do pay for me  now  there  s a good  dear fellow  before THEY ( looking back ) come up  Burs  ( aside ) I love to make him lick the dust  ( Aloud ) Hollo  here  s Finsbury waiting to be paid  lads  ( To the lads who are in the back scene ) Who has paid  and who has not paid  I say  ( The lads come forward  and several exclaim at once ) I  ve paid  I  ve paid  Enter LORD JOHN and RORY O  RYAN  Rory  Oh  King of Fashion  how fine we are  Why  now  to look at ye all one might fancy one  s self at the playhouse at once  or at a fancy ball in dear little Dublin  Come  strike up a dance  Burs  Pshaw  Wherever you come  Rory O  Ryan  no one else can be heard  Who has paid  and who has not paid  I say  Several Boys exclaim  We  ve all paid  st Boy  I  ve not paid  but here  s my money  Several Boys  We have not paid  but here  s our money  th Boy  Order there  I am marshal  All that have paid march off to the staircase  and take your seats there  one by one  March  ( As they march by  one by one  so as to display their dresses  Mr  Finsbury bows  and says ) A thousand thanks  gentlemen  Thank you  gentlemen  Thanks  gentlemen  The finest sight ever I saw out of Lon  on  Rory  as each lad passes  catches his arm  Are you a TalbotITE or a WheelerITE  To each who answers  A Wheelerite  Rory replies   Phoo  dance off  then  Go to the devil and shake yourself  Each who answers  A Talbotite  Rory shakes by the hand violently  singing   Talbot  oh  Talbot  s the dog for Rory   This is the name of a country dance  When they have almost all passed  Lord John says  But where can Mr  Talbot be all this time  Burs  Who knows  Who cares  Wheel  A pretty electioneerer  ( Aside to Bursal ) Finsbury  s waiting to be paid  Lord J  You don  t wait for me  Mr  Finsbury  You know  I have settled with you  Fins  Yes  my lord  yes  Many thanks  and I have left your lordship  s dress here  and everybody  s dress  I believe  as bespoke  Burs  Here  Finsbury  is the money for Wheeler  who  between you and me  is as poor as a rat  Wheeler ( affecting to laugh ) Well  I hope I shall be as rich as a Jew to  morrow  ( Bursal counts money  in an ostentatious manner  into Finsbury  s hand ) Fins  A thousand thanks for all favours  Rory  You will be kind enough to LAVE Mr  Talbot  s dress with me  Mr  Finsbury  for I  m a friend  Fins  Indubitably  sir  but the misfortune is  he  he  he  Mr  Talbot  sir  has bespoke no dress  Your servant  gentlemen  ( Exit Finsbury ) Burs  So your friend Mr  Talbot could not afford to bespeak a dress  ( Bursal and Wheeler laugh insolently ) How comes that  I wonder  Lord J  If I  m not mistaken  here comes Talbot to answer for himself  Rory  But who  in the name of St  Patrick  has he along with him  Enter TALBOT and LANDLORD  Talb  Come in along with us  Farmer Hearty  come in  ( Whilst the Farmer comes in  the boys who were sitting on the stairs  rise and exclaim ) Whom have we here  What now  Come down  lads  here  s more fun  Rory  What  s here  Talbot  Talb  An honest farmer  and a good natured landlord  who would come here along with me to speak  Farm  ( interrupting ) To speak the truth ( strikes his stick on the ground ) Landlord ( unbuttoning his waistcoat ) But I am so hot  so short  winded  that ( panting and puffing ) that for the soul and body of me  I cannot say what I have got for to say  Rory   Faith  now  the more short winded a story  the better  to my fancy  Burs  Wheeler  what  s the matter  man  you look as if your under jaw was broke  Farm  The matter is  young gentlemen  that there was once upon a time a fine  bay hunter  Wheel  ( squeezing up to Talbot  aside ) Don  t expose me  don  t let him tell  ( To the Farmer ) I  ll pay for the corn I spoiled  ( To the Landlord ) I  ll pay for the horse  Farm  I does not want to be paid for my corn  The short of it is  young gentlemen  this  un here  in the fine thing  em  bobs ( pointing to Wheeler ) is a shabby fellow  he went and spoiled Master Newington  s best hunter  Land  ( panting ) Ruinationed him  ruinationed him  Rory  But was that all the shabbiness  Now I might  or any of us might  have had such an accident as that  I suppose he paid the gentleman for the horse  or will do so  in good time  Land  ( holding his sides ) Oh  that I had but a little breath in this body o  mine to speak all  speak on  Farmer  Farm  ( striking his stick on the floor ) Oons  sir  when a man  s put out  he can  t go on with his story  Omnes  Be quiet  Rory  hush  ( Rory puts his finger on his lips ) Farm  Why  sir  I was a  going to tell you the shabbiness  why  sir  he did not pay the landlord  here  for the horse  but he goes and says to the landlord  here  Mr  Talbot had your horse on the self  same day   twas he did the damage   tis from he you must get your money  So Mr  Talbot  here  who is another sort of a gentleman ( though he has not so fine a coat ) would not see a man at a loss  that could not afford it  and not knowing which of  em it was that spoiled the horse  goes  when he finds the other would not pay a farthing  and pays all  Rory ( rubbing his hands ) There  s Talbot for ye  And  now  gentlemen ( to Wheeler and Bursal ) you guess the RASON  as I do  I suppose  why he bespoke no dress  he had not money enough to be fine  and honest  too  You are very fine  Mr  Wheeler  to do you justice  Lord J  Pray  Mr  O  Ryan  let the farmer go on  he has more to say  How did you find out  pray  my good friend  that it was not Talbot who spoiled the horse  Speak loud enough to be heard by everybody  Farm  Ay  that I will  I say ( very loudly ) I say I saw him there ( pointing to Wheeler ) take the jump which strained the horse  and I  m ready to swear to it  Yet he let another pay  there  s the shabbiness  ( A general groan from all the lads   Oh  shabby Wheeler  shabby  I  ll not vote for shabby Wheeler ) Lord J  ( aside ) Alas  I must vote for him  Rory sings   True game to the last  no Wheeler for me  Talbot  oh  Talbot  s the dog for me  ( Several voices join the chorus ) Burs  Wheeler  if you are not chosen Captain  you must see and pay me for the dress  Wheel  I am as poor as a rat  Rory  Oh  yes  oh yes  hear ye  hear ye  all manner of men  the election is now going to begin forthwith in the big field  and Rory O  Ryan holds the poll for Talbot  Talbot for ever  huzza  ( Exit Rory  followed by the Boys  who exclaim  Talbot for ever  huzza  The Landlord and Farmer join them ) Lord J  Talbot  I am glad you are what I always thought you  I  m glad you did not write that odious song  I would not lose such a friend for all the songs in the world  Forgive me for my hastiness this morning  I  ve punished myself  I  ve promised to vote for Wheeler  Talb  Oh  no matter whom you vote for  my lord  if you are still my friend  and if you know me to be yours  ( They shake hands )

down to me  mamma  I  ve something to whisper to you  ( Lady Piercefield stoops down  Violetta throws her arms round her mother  s neck ) Violet  ( aside to her mother ) Mamma  do you know  you know you want a governess for me  Lady P  Yes  if I could find a good one  Violet  ( aloud ) Stoop again  mamma  I  ve more to whisper  ( Aside to her mother ) SHE says she will be my governess  if you

 Lady P  Yes  you may depend upon it  it was the Airly Castle that was lost  You know I am just come from Portsmouth  where I went to meet my brother  Governor Morton  who came home with the last India fleet  and from whom I had the intelligence  ( Here Violetta interrupts  to ask her mother for her nosegay  Lady P  gives it to her  then goes on speaking ) Lady P  They were in such haste  foolish people  to carry their news to London  that they mistook one castle for another  But do you know that Mr  Bursal loses fifty thousand pounds  it is said  by the Airly Castle  When I told him she was lost  I thought he would have dropped down  However  I found he comforted himself afterwards with a bottle of Burgundy  but poor Miss Bursal has been in hysterics ever since  Mrs  T  Poor girl  My Louisa  YOU did not fall into hysterics  when I told you of the loss of our whole fortune  ( Violetta  during this dialogue  has been seated on the ground making up a nosegay ) Violet  ( aside ) Fall into hysterics  What are hysterics  I wonder  Louisa  Miss Bursal is much to be pitied  for the loss of wealth will be the loss of happiness to her  Lady P  It is to be hoped that the loss may at

FORGIVE AND FORGET  In the neighbourhood of a seaport town in the west of England  there lived a gardener  who had one son  called Maurice  to whom he was very partial  One day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to purchase some garden seeds for him  When Maurice got to the seed  shop  it was full of people  who were all impatient to be served  first a great tall man  and next a great fat woman pushed before him  and he stood quietly beside the counter  waiting till somebody should be at leisure to attend to him  At length  when all the other people who were in the shop had got what they wanted  the shopman turned to Maurice  And what do you want  my patient little fellow  said he   I want all these seeds for my father  said Maurice  putting a list of seeds into the shopman  s hand   and I have brought money to pay for them all  The seedsman looked out all the seeds that Maurice wanted  and packed them up in paper  he was folding up some painted lady  peas  when  from a door at the back of the shop  there came in a square  rough  faced man  who exclaimed  the moment he came in   Are the seeds I ordered ready  The wind  s fair  they ought to have been aboard yesterday  And my china jar  is it packed up and directed  where is it   It is up there on the shelf over your head  sir  answered the seedsman   It is very safe  you see  but we have not had time to pack it yet  It shall be done to  day  and we will get the seeds ready for you  sir  immediately   Immediately  then stir about it  The seeds will not pack themselves up  Make haste  pray   Immediately  sir  as soon as I have done up the parcel for this little boy   What signifies the parcel for this little boy  He can wait  and I cannot  wind and tide wait for no man  Here  my good lad  take your parcel  and sheer off  said the impatient man  and  as he spoke  he took up the parcel of seeds from the counter  as the shopman stooped to look for a sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up  The parcel was but loosely folded up  and as the impatient man lifted it  the weight of the peas which were withinside of it burst the paper  and all the seeds fell out upon the floor  whilst Maurice in vain held his hands to catch them  The peas rolled to all parts of the shop  the impatient man swore at them  but Maurice  without being out of humour  set about collecting them as fast as possible  Whilst the boy was busied in this manner  the man got what seeds he wanted  and as he was talking about them  a sailor came into the shop  and said   Captain  the wind has changed within these five minutes  and it looks as if we should have ugly weather   Well  I  m glad of it  replied the rough faced man  who was the captain of a ship   I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore  and I  ve business enough on my hands  The captain pushed forward towards the shop door  Maurice  who was kneeling on the floor  picking up his seeds  saw that the captain  s foot was entangled in some packthread which hung down from the shelf on which the china jar stood  Maurice saw that  if the captain took one more step forward  he must pull the string  so that it would throw down the jar  round the bottom of which the packthread was entangled  He immediately caught hold of the captain  s leg  and stopped him   Stay  Stand still  sir  said he   or you will break your china jar  The man stood still  looked  and saw how the packthread had caught in his shoe buckle  and how it was near dragging down his beautiful china jar   I am really very much obliged to you  my little fellow  said he   You have saved my jar  which I would not have broken for ten guineas  for it is for my wife  and I  ve brought it safe from abroad many a league  It would have been a pity if I had broken it just when it was safe landed  I am really much obliged to you  my little fellow  this was returning good for evil  I am sorry I threw down your seeds  as you are such a good natured  forgiving boy  Be so kind  continued he  turning to the shopman   as to reach down that china jar for me  The shopman lifted down the jar very carefully  and the captain took off the cover  and pulled out some tulip roots   You seem  by the quantity of seeds you have got  to belong to a gardener  Are you fond of gardening  said he to Maurice   Yes  sir  replied Maurice   very fond of it  for my father is a gardener  and he lets me help him at his work  and he has given me a little garden of my own   Then here are a couple of tulip  roots for you  and if you take care of them  I  ll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in England in your little garden  These tulips were given to me by a Dutch merchant  who told me that they were some of the rarest and finest in Holland  They will prosper with you  I  m sure  wind and weather permitting  Maurice thanked the gentleman  and returned home  eager to show his precious tulip  roots to his father  and to a companion of his  the son of a nurseryman  who lived near him  Arthur was the name of the nurseryman  s son  The first thing Maurice did  after showing his tulip  roots to his father  was to run to Arthur  s garden in search of him  Their gardens were separated only by a low wall of loose stones   Arthur  Arthur  where are you  Are you in your garden  I want you  But Arthur made no answer  and did not  as usual  come running to meet his friend   I know where you are  continued Maurice   and I  m coming to you as fast as the raspberry  bushes will let me  I have good news for you  something you  ll be delighted to see  Arthur  Ha  but here is something that I am not delighted to see  I am sure  said poor Maurice  who  when he had got through the raspberry  bushes  and had come in sight of his own garden  beheld his bell  glass  his beloved bell  glass  under which his cucumbers were grown so finely  his only bell  glass  broken to pieces   I am sorry for it  said Arthur  who stood leaning upon his spade in his own garden   I am afraid you will be very angry with me   Why  was it you  Arthur  broke my bell  glass  Oh  how could you do so   I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall  and by accident a great lump of couch  grass  with stones hanging to the roots  fell upon your bell  glass  and broke it  as you see  Maurice lifted up the lump of couch  grass  which had fallen through the broken glass upon his cucumbers  and he looked at his cucumbers for a moment in silence  Oh  my poor cucumbers  you must all die now  I shall see all your yellow flowers withered tomorrow  but it is done  and it cannot be helped  so  Arthur  let us say no more about it   You are very good  I thought you would have been angry  I am sure I should have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass  if it had been mine   Oh  forgive and forget  as my father always says  that  s the best way  Look what I have got for you  Then he told Arthur the story of the captain of the ship  and the china jar  the seeds having been thrown down  and of the fine tulip  roots which had been given to him  and Maurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to Arthur  who thanked him with great joy  and repeatedly said   How good you were not to be angry with me for breaking your bell  glass  I am much more sorry for it than if you had been in a passion with me  Arthur now went to plant his tulip  root  and Maurice looked at the beds which his companion had been digging  and at all the things which were coming up in his garden   I don  t know how it is  said Arthur   but you always seem as glad to see the things in my garden coming up  and doing well  as if they were all your own  I am much happier since my father came to live here  and since you and I have been allowed to work and to play together  than I ever was before  for you must know  before we came to live here  I had a cousin in the house with me  who used to plague me  He was not nearly so good  natured as you are  He never took pleasure in looking at my garden  or at anything that I did that was well done  and he never gave me a share of anything that he had  and so I did not like him  how could I  But  I believe that hating people makes us unhappy  for I know I never was happy when I was quarrelling with him  and I am always happy with you  Maurice  You know we never quarrel  It would be well for all the world if they could be convinced  like Arthur  that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel  It would be well for all the world if they followed Maurice  s maxim of  Forgive and Forget  when they receive  or when they imagine that they receive  an injury  Arthur  s father  Mr  Oakly  the nurseryman  was apt to take offence at trifles  and when he thought that any of his neighbours disobliged him  he was too proud to ask them to explain their conduct  therefore he was often mistaken in his judgment of them  He thought that it showed SPIRIT  to remember and to resent an injury  and  therefore  though he was not an ill  natured man  he was sometimes led  by this mistaken idea of SPIRIT  to do ill  natured things   A warm friend and a bitter enemy  was one of his maxims  and he had many more enemies than friends  He was not very rich  but he was proud  and his favourite proverb was   Better live in spite than in pity  When first he settled near Mr  Grant  the gardener  he felt inclined to dislike him  because he was told that Mr  Grant was a Scotchman  and he had a prejudice against Scotchmen  all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious  because he had once been over  reached by a Scotch peddler  Grant  s friendly manners in some degree conquered this prepossession but still he secretly suspected that THIS CIVILITY  as he said   was all show  and that he was not  nor could not  being a Scotchman  be such a hearty friend as a true  born Englishman  Grant had some remarkably fine raspberries  The fruit was so large  as to be quite a curiosity  When it was in season  many strangers came from the neighbouring town  which was a sea  bathing place  to look at these raspberries  which obtained the name of Brobdingnag raspberries   How came you  pray  neighbour Grant  if a man may ask  by these wonderful fine raspberries  said Mr  Oakly  one evening  to the gardener   That  s a secret  replied Grant  with an arch smile   Oh  in case it  s a secret  I  ve no more to say  for I never meddle with any man  s secrets that he does not choose to trust me with  But I wish  neighbour Grant  you would put down that book  You are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you  which is not  according to my notions ( being a plain  UNLARNED Englishman bred and born ) so civil and neighbourly as might be  Mr  Grant hastily shut his book  but remarked  with a shrewd glance at his son  that it was in that book he found his Brobdingnag raspberries   You are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not the luck to be as book  LARNED as yourself  Mr  Grant  but I take it  being only a plain spoken Englishman  as I observed afore  that one is to the full as like to find a raspberry in one  s garden as in one  s book  Mr  Grant  Grant  observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly tone  did not contradict him  being well versed in the Bible  he knew that  A soft word turneth away wrath  and he answered  in a good humoured voice   I hear  neighbour Oakly  you are likely to make a great deal of money of your nursery this year  Here  s to the health of you and yours  not forgetting the seedling larches  which I see are coming on finely   Thank ye  neighbour  kindly  the larches are coming on tolerably well  that  s certain  and here  s to your good health  Mr  Grant  you and yours  not forgetting your  what dye call  em raspberries ( drinks ) and  after a pause  resumes   I  m not apt to be a beggar  neighbour  but if you could give me  Here Mr  Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers  and he did finish making his request  Mr  Oakly was not  as he said of himself  apt to ask favours  and nothing but Grant  s cordiality could have conquered his prejudices  so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a Scotchman  He was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag raspberry  plants  The next day the thought of the raspberry  plants recurred to his memory  but being a bashful man  he did not like to go himself on purpose to make his request  and he desired his wife  who was just setting out to market  to call at Grant  s gate  and  if he was at work in his garden  to ask him for a few plants of his raspberries  The answer which Oakly  s wife brought to him was that Mr  Grant had not a raspberry  plant in the world to give him  and that if he had ever so many  he would not give one away  except to his own son  Oakly flew into a passion when he received such a message  declared it was just such a mean  shabby trick as might have been expected from a Scotchman  called himself a booby  a dupe  and a blockhead  for ever having trusted to the civil speeches of a Scotchman  swore that he would die in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour  be it ever so small  from a Scotchman  related to his wife  for the hundredth time  the way in which he had been taken in by the Scotch peddler ten years ago  and concluded by forswearing all further intercourse with Mr  Grant  and all belonging to him   Son Arthur  said he  addressing himself to the boy  who just then came in from work  Son Arthur  do you hear me  let me never again see you with Grant  s son   With Maurice  father   With Maurice Grant  I say  I forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anything to do with him   Oh  why  dear father   Ask no questions but do as I bid you  Arthur burst out a crying  and only said   Yes  father  I  ll do as you bid me  to be sure   Why now  what does the boy cry for  Is there no other boy  simpleton  think you  to play with  but this Scotchman  s son  I  ll find out another play  fellow for ye  child  if that be all   That  s not all  father  said Arthur  trying to stop himself from sobbing   but the thing is  I shall never have such another play  fellow   I shall never have such another friend as Maurice Grant   Like father like son  you may think yourself well off to have done with him   Done with him  Oh  father  and shall I never go again to work in his garden  and may not he come to mine   No  replied Oakly  sturdily   his father has used me uncivil  and no man shall use me uncivil twice  I say no  Wife  sweep up this hearth  Boy  don  t take on like a fool  but eat thy bacon and greens  and let  s hear no more of Maurice Grant  Arthur promised to obey his father  He only begged that he might once more speak to Maurice  and tell him that it was by his father  s orders he acted  This request was granted  but when Arthur further begged to know what reason he might give for this separation  his father refused to tell his reasons  The two friends took leave of one another very sorrowfully  Mr  Grant  when he heard of all this  endeavoured to discover what could have offended his neighbour  but all explanation was prevented by the obstinate silence of Oakly  Now  the message which Grant really sent about the Brobdingnag raspberries was somewhat different from that which Mr  Oakly received  The message was  that the raspberries were not Mr  Grant  s  that therefore he had no right to give them away  that they belonged to his son Maurice  and that this was not the right time of year for planting them  This message had been unluckily misunderstood  Grant gave his answer to his wife  she to a Welsh servant  girl  who did not perfectly comprehend her mistress  broad Scotch  and she in her turn could not make herself intelligible to Mrs  Oakly  who hated the Welsh accent  and whose attention  when the servant  girl delivered the message  was principally engrossed by the management of her own horse  The horse  on which Mrs  Oakly rode this day being ill  broken  would not stand still quietly at the gate  and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer  and to ride on to market  Oakly  when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour Grant  could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint  There was in Grant  s garden a plum  tree  which was planted close to the loose stone wall that divided the garden from the nursery  The soil in which the plum tree was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was on the opposite side of the wall  and the plum  tree had forced its way through the wall  and gradually had taken possession of the ground which it liked best  Oakly thought the plum  tree  as it belonged to Mr  Grant  had no right to make its appearance on his ground  an attorney told him that he might oblige Grant to cut it down  but Mr  Grant refused to cut down his plum  tree at the attorney  s desire  and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to law about the business  and the lawsuit went on for some months  The attorney  at the end of this time  came to Oakly with a demand for money to carry on his suit  assuring him that  in a short time  it would be determined in his favour  Oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas  remarked that it was a great sum for him to pay  and that nothing but the love of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of ground   which  after all  said he   is not worth twopence  The plum  tree does me little or no damage  but I don  t like to be imposed upon by a Scotchman  The attorney saw and took advantage of Oakly  s prejudice against the natives of Scotland  and he persuaded him  that to show the SPIRIT of a true  born Englishman it was necessary  whatever it might cost him  to persist in this law suit  It was soon after this conversation with the attorney that Mr  Oakly walked  with resolute steps  towards the plum  tree  saying to himself   If it cost me a hundred pounds I will not let this cunning Scotchman get the better of me  Arthur interrupted his father  s reverie  by pointing to a book and some young plants which lay upon the wall   I fancy  father  said he   those things are for you  for there is a little note directed to you  in Maurice  s handwriting  Shall I bring it to you   Yes  let me read it  child  since I must  It contained these words   DEAR MR  OAKLY  I don  t know why you have quarrelled with us  I am very sorry for it  But though you are angry with me  I am not angry with you  I hope you will not refuse some of my Brobdingnag raspberry  plants  which you asked for a great while ago  when we were all good friends  It was not the right time of the year to plant them  which was the reason they were not sent to you  but it is just the right time to plant them now  and I send you the book  in which you will find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their roots  and I have got some seaweed ashes for you  You will find the ashes in the flower  pot upon the wall  I have never spoken to Arthur  nor he to me  since you bid us not  So  wishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours  and longing to be all friends again  I am  with love to dear Arthur and self   Your affectionate neighbour  s son   MAURICE GRANT   P  S  It is now about four months since the quarrel began  and that is a very long while  A great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon Oakly  because he was not very expert in reading writing  and it cost him much trouble to spell it and put it together  However  he seemed affected by it  and said   I believe this Maurice loves you well enough  Arthur  and he seems a good sort of boy  but as to the raspberries  I believe all that he says about them is but an excuse  and  at anyrate  as I could not get  em when I asked for them  I  ll not have  em now  Do you hear me  I say  Arthur  What are you reading there  Arthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book  which Maurice had left along with the raspberry  plants upon the wall  Arthur read aloud as follows  ( Monthly Magazine  Dec     p   )  There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey  which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter  in like manner as many plants in England are with litter from the stable  These strawberries are usually of the largeness of a middle  sized apricot  and the flavour is particularly grateful  In Jersey and Guernsey  situate scarcely one degree farther south than Cornwall  all kinds of fruit  pulse  and vegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three weeks sooner than in England  even on the southern shores  and snow will scarcely remain twenty  four hours on the earth  Although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt  and consequently a moist atmosphere  yet the ashes ( seaweed ashes ) made use of as manure  may also have their portion of influence   It is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually tried upon raspberry  plants   And here  continued Arthur   is something written with a pencil  on a slip of paper  and it is Maurice  s writing  I will read it to you   When I read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as large as apricots  after they had been covered over with seaweed  I thought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father  s raspberries  and I asked him if he would give me leave to try them  He gave me leave  and I went directly and gathered together some seaweed that had been cast on shore  and I dried it  and burned it  and then I manured the raspberries with it  and the year afterwards the raspberries grew to the size that you have seen  Now  the reason I tell you this is  first  that you may know how to manage your raspberries  and next  because I remember you looked very grave  as if you were not pleased with my father  Mr  Grant  when he told you that the way by which he came by his Brobdingnag raspberries was a secret  Perhaps this was the thing that has made you so angry with us all  for you never have come to see father since that evening  Now I have told you all I know  and so I hope you will not be angry with us any longer  Mr  Oakly was much pleased by this openness  and said   Why now  Arthur  this is something like  this is telling one the thing one wants to know  without fine speeches  This is like an Englishman more than a Scotchman  Pray  Arthur  do you know whether your friend Maurice was born in England or in Scotland   No  indeed  sir  I don  t know  I never asked  I did not think it signified  All I know is  that wherever he was born  he is VERY good  Look  papa  my tulip is blowing   Upon my word  said his father   this will be a beautiful tulip   It was given to me by Maurice   And did you give him nothing for it  was the father  s inquiry   Nothing in the world  and he gave it to me just at the time when he had good cause to be angry with me  just when I had broken his bell  glass   I have a great mind to let you play together again  said Arthur  s father   Oh  if you would  cried Arthur  clapping his hands   how happy we should be  Do you know  father  I have often sat for an hour at a time up in that crab  tree  looking at Maurice at work in his garden  and wishing that I was at work with him  Here Arthur was interrupted by the attorney  who came to ask Mr  Oakly some question about the lawsuit concerning the plum  tree  Oakly showed him Maurice  s letter  and to Arthur  s extreme astonishment  the attorney had no sooner read it  than he exclaimed   What an artful little gentleman this is  I never  in the course of all my practice  met with anything better  Why  this is the most cunning letter I ever read   Where  s the cunning  said Oakly  and he put on his spectacles   My good sir  don  t you see  that all this stuff about Brobdingnag raspberries is to ward off your suit about the plum  tree  They know  that is  Mr  Grant  who is sharp enough  knows  that he will be worsted in that suit  that he must  in short  pay you a good round sum for damages  if it goes on   Damages  said Oakly  staring round him at the plum  tree   but I don  t know what you mean  I mean nothing but what  s honest  I don  t mean to ask for any good round sum  for the plum  tree has done me no great harm by coming into my garden  but only I don  t choose it should come there without my leave   Well  well  said the attorney   I understand all that  but what I want to make you  Mr  Oakly  understand  is  that this Grant and his son only want to make up matters with you  and prevent the thing  s coming to a fair trial  by sending on  in this underhand sort of way  a bribe of a few raspberries   A bribe  exclaimed Oakly   I never took a bribe  and I never will  and  with sudden indignation  he pulled the raspberry plants from the ground in which Arthur was planting them  and he threw them over the wall into Grant  s garden  Maurice had put his tulip  which was beginning to blow  in a flower  pot  on the top of the wall  in hopes that his friend Arthur would see it from day to day  Alas  he knew not in what a dangerous situation he had placed it  One of his own Brobdingnag raspberry  plants  swung by the angry arm of Oakly  struck off the head of his precious tulip  Arthur  who was full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney was mistaken in his judgment of poor Maurice  did not observe the fall of the tulip  The next day  when Maurice saw his raspberry  plants scattered upon the ground  and his favourite tulip broken  he was in much astonishment  and  for some moments  angry  but anger  with him  never lasted long  He was convinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake  He could not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on purpose  And even if they did all this on purpose to vex me  said he to himself   the best thing I can do  is  not to let it vex me  Forgive and forget  This temper of mind Maurice was more happy in enjoying than he could have been made  without it  by the possession of all the tulips in Holland  Tulips were  at this time  things of great consequence in the estimation of the country several miles round where Maurice and Arthur lived  There was a florist  s feast to be held at the neighbouring town  at which a prize of a handsome set of gardening  tools was to be given to the person who could produce the finest flower of its kind  A tulip was the flower which was thought the finest the preceding year  and consequently numbers of people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip  roots  in hopes of obtaining the prize this year  Arthur  s tulip was beautiful  As he examined it from day to day  and every day thought it improving  he longed to thank his friend Maurice for it  and he often mounted into his crab  tree  to look into Maurice  s garden  in hopes of seeing his tulip also in full bloom and beauty  He never could see it  The day of the florist  s feast arrived  and Oakly went with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting  It was on a spacious bowling  green  All the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the bowling  green  and  amongst all this gay variety  the tulip which Maurice had given to Arthur appeared conspicuously beautiful  To the owner of this tulip the prize was adjudged  and  as the handsome garden  tools were delivered to Arthur  he heard a well known voice wish him joy  He turned  looked about him  and saw his friend Maurice   But  Maurice  where is your own tulip  said Mr  Oakly   I thought  Arthur  you told me that he kept one for himself   So I did  said Maurice   but somebody ( I suppose by accident ) broke it   Somebody  who  cried Arthur and Mr  Oakly at once   Somebody who threw the raspberry  plants back again over the wall  replied Maurice   That was me  that somebody was me  said Oakly   I scorn to deny it  but I did not intend to break your tulip  Maurice   Dear Maurice  said Arthur  you know I may call him dear Maurice  now you are by  papa  here are all the garden  tools  take them  and welcome   Not one of them  said Maurice  drawing back   Offer them to the father  offer them to Mr  Grant  whispered Oakly   he  ll take them  I  ll answer for it  Mr  Oakly was mistaken  the father would not accept of the tools  Mr  Oakly stood surprised  Certainly  said he to himself   this cannot be such a miser as I took him for  and he walked immediately up to Grant  and bluntly said to him   Mr  Grant  your son has behaved very handsomely to my son  and you seem to be glad of it   To be sure I am  said Grant  Which  continued Oakly   gives me a better opinion of you than ever I had before  I mean  than ever I had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those foolish  what d  ye call em  cursed raspberries   What shabby answer  said Grant  with surprise  and Oakly repeated exactly the message which he received  and Grant declared that he never sent any such message  He repeated exactly the answer which he really sent  and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him  saying  I believe you  no more need be said  I  m only sorry I did not ask you about this four months ago  and so I should have done if you had not been a Scotchman  Till now  I never rightly liked a Scotchman  We may thank this good little fellow  continued he  turning to Maurice   for our coming at last to a right understanding  There was no holding out against his good nature  I  m sure  from the bottom of my heart  I  m sorry I broke his tulip  Shake hands  boys  I  m glad to see you  Arthur  look so happy again  and hope Mr  Grant will forgive   Oh  forgive and forget  said Grant and his son at the same moment  And from this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each other  Oakly laughed at his own folly  in having been persuaded to go to law about the plum  tree  and he  in process of time  so completely conquered his early prejudice against Scotchmen  that he and Grant became partners in business  Mr  Grant  s book  LARNING and knowledge of arithmetic he found highly useful to him  and he  on his side  possessed a great many active  good qualities  which became serviceable to his partner  The two boys rejoiced in this family union  and Arthur often declared that they owed all their happiness to Maurice  s favourite maxim   Forgive and Forget  WASTE NOT  WANT NOT  or TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW  Mr  Gresham  a Bristol merchant  who had  by honourable industry and economy  accumulated a considerable fortune  retired from business to a new house which he had built upon the Downs  near Clifton  Mr  Gresham  however  did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy  He did not propose to live in idleness and extravagance  for such a life would have been equally incompatible with his habits and his principles  He was fond of children  and as he had no sons  he determined to adopt one of his relations  He had two nephews  and he invited both of them to his house  that he might have an opportunity of judging of their dispositions  and of the habits which they had acquired  Hal and Benjamin  Mr  Gresham  s nephews  were about ten years old  They had been educated very differently  Hal was the son of the elder branch of the family  His father was a gentleman  who spent rather more than he could afford  and Hal  from the example of the servants in his father  s family  with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood  learned to waste more of everything than he used  He had been told that  gentlemen should be above being careful and saving  and he had unfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a generous disposition  and economy of an avaricious one  Benjamin  on the contrary  had been taught habits of care and foresight  His father had but a very small fortune  and was anxious that his son should early learn that economy ensures independence  and sometimes puts it in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous  The morning after these two boys arrived at their uncle  s they were eager to see all the rooms in the house  Mr  Gresham accompanied them  and attended to their remarks and exclamations   Oh  what an excellent motto  exclaimed Ben  when he read the following words  which were written in large characters over the chimney  piece  in his uncle  s spacious kitchen   WASTE NOT  WANT NOT   Waste not  want not  repeated his cousin Hal  in rather a contemptuous tone   I think it looks stingy to servants  and no gentleman  s servants  cooks especially  would like to have such a mean motto always staring them in the face  Ben  who was not so conversant as his cousin in the ways of cooks and gentlemen  s servants  made no reply to these observations  Mr  Gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other rooms in the house  Some time afterwards  he heard their voices in the hall   Boys  said he   what are you doing there   Nothing  sir  said Hal   you were called away from us and we did not know which way to go   And have you nothing to do  said Mr  Gresham   No  sir  nothing  answered Hal  in a careless tone  like one who was well content with the state of habitual idleness   No  sir  nothing  replied Ben  in a voice of lamentation   Come  said Mr  Gresham   if you have nothing to do  lads  will you unpack those two parcels for me  The two parcels were exactly alike  both of them well tied up with good whip cord  Ben took his parcel to a table  and  after breaking off the sealing wax  began carefully to examine the knot  and then to untie it  Hal stood still  exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands  and tried first at one corner  and then at another  to pull the string off by force   I wish these people wouldn  t tie up their parcels so tight  as if they were never to be undone  cried he  as he tugged at the cord  and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it   Ben  why  how did you get yours undone  man  what  s in your parcel  I wonder what is in mine  I wish I could get this string off  I must cut it   Oh  no  said Ben  who now had undone the last knot of his parcel  and who drew out the length of string with exultation   don  t cut it  Hal  look what a nice cord this is  and yours is the same  it  s a pity to cut it   WASTE NOT  WANT NOT  you know   Pooh  said Hal   what signifies a bit of packthread   It is whip cord  said Ben   Well  whip cord  what signifies a bit of whip cord  you can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence  and who cares for twopence  Not I  for one  so here it goes  cried Hal  drawing out his knife  and he cut the cord  precipitately  in sundry places   Lads  have you undone the parcels for me  said Mr  Gresham  opening the parlour door as he spoke   Yes  sir  cried Hal  and he dragged off his half cut  half entangled string  here  s the parcel   And here  s my parcel  uncle  and here  s the string  said Ben   You may keep the string for your pains  said Mr  Gresham   Thank you  sir  said Ben   what an excellent whip cord it is   And you  Hal  continued Mr  Gresham   you may keep your string too  if it will be of any use to you   It will be of no use to me  thank you  sir  said Hal   No  I am afraid not  if this be it  said his uncle  taking up the jagged knotted remains of Hal  s cord  A few days after this  Mr  Gresham gave to each of his nephews a new top   But how  s this  said Hal   these tops have no strings  what shall we do for strings   I have a string that will do very well for mine  said Ben  and he pulled out of his pocket the fine  long  smooth string  which had tied up the parcel  With this he soon set up his top  which spun admirably well   Oh  how I wish I had but a string  said Hal   What shall I do for a string  I  ll tell you what  I can use the string that goes round my hat   But then  said Ben   what will you do for a hat  band   I  ll manage to do without one  said Hal  and he took the string of his hat for his top  It soon was worn through  and he split his top by driving the pea too tightly into it  His cousin Ben let him set up his the next day  but Hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he meddled with other people  s things than when he managed his own  He had scarcely played half an hour before he split it  by driving the peg too violently  Ben bore this misfortune with good humour   Come  said he   it can  t be helped  but give me the string because THAT may still be of use for something else  It happened some time afterwards that a lady  who had been intimately acquainted with Hal  s mother at Bath  that is to say  who had frequently met her at the card  table during the winter  now arrived at Clifton  She was informed by his mother that Hal was at Mr  Gresham  s  and her sons  who were FRIENDS of his  came to see him  and invited him to spend the next day with them  Hal joyfully accepted the invitation  He was always glad to go out to dine  because it gave him something to do  something to think of  or at least something to say  Besides this  he had been educated to think it was a fine thing to visit fine people  and Lady Diana Sweepstakes ( for that was the name of his mother  s acquaintance ) was a very fine lady  and her two sons intended to be very great gentlemen  He was in a prodigious hurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his uncle  s door the next day  but just as he got to the hall door  little Patty called to him from the top of the stairs  and told him that he had dropped his pocket  handkerchief   Pick it up  then  and bring it to me  quick  can  t you  child  cried Hal   for Lady Di  s sons are waiting for me  Little Patty did not know anything about Lady Di  s sons  but as she was very good  natured  and saw that her cousin Hal was  for some reason or other  in a desperate hurry  she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly could towards the landing  place  where the handkerchief lay  but  alas  before she reached the handkerchief  she fell  rolling down a whole flight of stairs  and when her fall was at last stopped by the landing  place  she did not cry out  she writhed  as if she was in great pain   Where are you hurt  my love  said Mr  Gresham  who came instantly  on hearing the noise of someone falling downstairs   Where are you hurt  my dear   Here  papa  said the little girl  touching her ankle  which she had decently covered with her gown   I believe I am hurt here  but not much  added she  trying to rise   only it hurts me when I move   I  ll carry you  don  t move then  said her father  and he took her up in his arms   My shoe  I  ve lost one of my shoes  said she  Ben looked for it upon the stairs  and he found it sticking in a loop of whip cord  which was entangled round one of the bannisters  When this cord was drawn forth  it appeared that it was the very same jagged  entangled piece which Hal had pulled off his parcel  He had diverted himself with running up and downstairs  whipping the bannisters with it  as he thought he could convert it to no better use  and  with his usual carelessness  he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw it when the dinner bell rang  Poor little Patty  s ankle was terribly strained  and Hal reproached himself for his folly  and would have reproached himself longer  perhaps  if Lady Di Sweepstakes  sons had not hurried him away  In the evening  Patty could not run about as she used to do  but she sat upon the sofa  and she said  that she did not feel the pain of her ankle SO MUCH  whilst Ben was so good as to play at JACK STRAWS with her   That  s right  Ben  never be ashamed of being good  natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself  said his uncle  smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord  to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat  s cradle   I shall not think you one bit less manly  because I see you playing at cat  s cradle with a little child of six years old  Hal  however  was not precisely of his uncle  s opinion  for when he returned in the evening  and saw Ben playing with his little cousin  he could not help smiling contemptuously  and asked if he had been playing at cat  s cradle all night  In a heedless manner he made some inquiries after Patty  s sprained ankle  and then he ran on to tell all the news he had heard at Lady Diana Sweepstakes  news which he thought would make him appear a person of vast importance   Do you know  uncle  do you know  Ben  said he  there  s to be the most FAMOUS doings that ever were heard of upon the Downs here  the first day of next month  which will be in a fortnight  thank my stars  I wish the fortnight was over  I shall think of nothing else  I know  till that happy day comes  Mr  Gresham inquired why the first of September was to be so much happier than any other day in the year   Why  replied Hal   Lady Diana Sweepstakes  you know  is a famous rider  and archer  and ALL THAT   Very likely  said Mr  Gresham  soberly   but what then   Dear uncle  cried Hal   but you shall hear  There  s to be a race upon the Downs on the first of September  and after the race  there  s to be an archery meeting for the ladies  and Lady Diana Sweepstakes is to be one of THEM  And after the ladies have done shooting  now  Ben  comes the best part of it  we boys are to have our turn  and Lady Di is to give a prize to the best marksman amongst us  of a very handsome bow and arrow  Do you know  I  ve been practising already  and I  ll show you  to  morrow  as soon as it comes home  the FAMOUS bow and arrow that Lady Diana has given me  but  perhaps  added he  with a scornful laugh   you like a cat  s cradle better than a bow and arrow  Ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment  but the next day  when Hal  s new bow and arrow came home  he convinced him that he knew how to use it very well   Ben  said his uncle   you seem to be a good marksman  though you have not boasted of yourself  I  ll give you a bow and arrow  and  perhaps  if you practise  you may make yourself an archer before the first of September  and  in the meantime  you will not wish the fortnight to be over  for you will have something to do   Oh  sir  interrupted Hal   but if you mean that Ben should put in for the prize  he must have a uniform   Why MUST he  said Mr  Gresham   Why  sir  because everybody has  I mean everybody that  s anybody  and Lady Diana was talking about the uniform all dinner time  and it  s settled  all about it  except the buttons  the young Sweepstakes are to get theirs made first for patterns  they are to be white  faced with green  and they  ll look very handsome  I  m sure  and I shall write to mamma to  night  as Lady Diana bid me  about mine  and I shall tell her to be sure to answer my letter  without fail  by return of post  and then  if mamma makes no objection  which I know she won  t  because she never thinks much about expense  and ALL THAT  then I shall bespeak my uniform  and get it made by the same tailor that makes for Lady Diana and the young Sweepstakes   Mercy upon us  said Mr  Gresham  who was almost stunned by the rapid vociferation with which this long speech about a uniform was pronounced   I don  t pretend to understand these things  added he  with an air of simplicity   but we will inquire  Ben  into the necessity of the case  and if it is necessary  or  if you think it necessary  that you shall have a uniform  why  I  ll give you one   YOU  uncle  Will you  INDEED  exclaimed Hal  with amazement painted in his countenance   Well  that  s the last thing in the world I should have expected  You are not at all the sort of person I should have thought would care about a uniform  and now I should have supposed you  d have thought it extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day  and I  m sure Lady Diana Sweepstakes thought as I do  for when I told her of that motto over your kitchen chimney   WASTE NOT  WANT NOT  she laughed  and said that I had better not talk to you about uniforms  and that my mother was the proper person to write to about my uniform  but I  ll tell Lady Diana  uncle  how good you are  and how much she was mistaken   Take care how you do that  said Mr  Gresham   for perhaps the lady was not mistaken   Nay  did not you say  just now  you would give poor Ben a uniform   I said I would  if he thought it necessary to have one   Oh  I  ll answer for it  he  ll think it necessary   said Hal  laughing   because it is necessary   Allow him  at least  to judge for himself  said Mr  Gresham   My dear uncle  but I assure you  said Hal  earnestly   there  s no judging about the matter  because really  upon my word  Lady Diana said distinctly  that her sons were to have uniforms  white faced with green  and a green and white cockade in their hats   May be so  said Mr  Gresham  still with the same look of calm simplicity   put on your hats  boys  and come with me  I know a gentleman whose sons are to be at this archery meeting  and we will inquire into all the particulars from him  Then  after we have seen him ( it is not eleven o  clock yet ) we shall have time enough to walk on to Bristol  and choose the cloth for Ben  s uniform  if it is necessary   I cannot tell what to make of all he says  whispered Hal  as he reached down his hat   do you think  Ben  he means to give you this uniform  or not   I think  said Ben   that he means to give me one  if it is necessary  or  as he said  if I think it is necessary   And that to be sure you will  won  t you  or else you  ll be a great fool  I know  after all I  ve told you  How can anyone in the world know so much about the matter as I  who have dined with Lady Diana Sweepstakes but yesterday  and heard all about it from beginning to end  And as for this gentleman that we are going to  I  m sure  if he knows anything about the matter  he  ll say exactly the same as I do   We shall hear  said Ben  with a degree of composure which Hal could by no means comprehend when a uniform was in question  The gentleman upon whom Mr  Gresham called had three sons  who were all to be at this archery meeting  and they unanimously assured him  in the presence of Hal and Ben  that they had never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion  and that  amongst the number of their acquaintance  they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an UNNECESSARY expense  Hal stood amazed   Such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand affairs of life  said Mr  Gresham  looking at his nephews   What amongst one set of people you hear asserted to be absolutely necessary  you will hear from another set of people is quite unnecessary  All that can be done  my dear boys  in these difficult cases  is to judge for yourselves  which opinions  and which people  are the most reasonable  Hal  who had been more accustomed to think of what was fashionable  than of what was reasonable  without at all considering the good sense of what his uncle said to him  replied  with childish petulance   Indeed  sir  I don  t know what other people think  but I only know what Lady Diana Sweepstakes said  The name of Lady Diana Sweepstakes  Hal thought  must impress all present with respect  he was highly astonished  when  as he looked round  he saw a smile of contempt upon everyone  s countenance  and he was yet further bewildered  when he heard her spoken of as a very silly  extravagant  ridiculous woman  whose opinion no prudent person would ask upon any subject  and whose example was to be shunned  instead of being imitated   Ay  my dear Hal  said his uncle  smiling at his look of amazement   these are some of the things that young people must learn from experience  All the world do not agree in opinion about characters  you will hear the same person admired in one company  and blamed in another  so that we must still come round to the same point   Judge for yourself  Hal  s thoughts were  however  at present too full of the uniform to allow his judgment to act with perfect impartiality  As soon as their visit was over  and all the time they walked down the hill from Prince  s Building  s towards Bristol  he continued to repeat nearly the same arguments  which he had formerly used  respecting necessity  the uniform  and Lady Diana Sweepstakes  To all this Mr  Gresham made no reply  and longer had the young gentleman expatiated upon the subject  which had so strongly seized upon his imagination  had not his senses been forcibly assailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting sight of certain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook  s shop   Oh  uncle  said he  as his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to Bristol   look at those jellies  pointing to a confectioner  s shop   I must buy some of those good things  for I have got some halfpence in my pocket   Your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent reason for eating  said Mr  Gresham  smiling   But I really am hungry  said Hal   you know  uncle  it is a good while since breakfast  His uncle  who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint  that he might judge their characters  bid them do as they pleased   Come  then  Ben  if you  ve any halfpence in your pocket   I  m not hungry  said Ben   I suppose THAT means that you  ve no halfpence  said Hal  laughing  with the look of superiority which he had been taught to think the RICH might assume towards those who were convicted either of poverty or economy   Waste not  want not  said Ben to himself  Contrary to his cousin  s surmise  he happened to have two pennyworth of halfpence actually in his pocket  At the very moment Hal stepped into the pastrycook  s shop  a poor  industrious man  with a wooden leg  who usually sweeps the dirty corner of the walk which turns at this spot to the Wells  held his hat to Ben  who  after glancing his eye at the petitioner  s well worn broom  instantly produced his twopence   I wish I had more halfpence for you  my good man  said he   but I  ve only twopence  Hal came out of Mr  Millar  s  the confectioner  s shop  with a hatful of cakes in his hand  Mr  Millar  s dog was sitting on the flags before the door  and he looked up with a wistful  begging eye at Hal  who was eating a queen cake  Hal  who was wasteful even in his good  nature  threw a whole queen cake to the dog  who swallowed it for a single mouthful   There goes twopence in the form of a queen cake  said Mr  Gresham  Hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin  but they thanked him  and refused to eat any  because  they said  they were not hungry  so he ate and ate as he walked along  till at last he stopped  and said   This bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes  I can  t bear it  and he was going to fling it from him into the river   Oh  it is a pity to waste that good bun  we may be glad of it yet  said Ben   give it me rather than throw it away   Why  I thought you said you were not hungry  said Hal   True  I am not hungry now  but that is no reason why I should never be hungry again   Well  there is the cake for you  Take it  for it has made me sick  and I don  t care what becomes of it  Ben folded the refuse bit of his cousin  s bun in a piece of paper  and put it into his pocket   I  m beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or something  said Hal   and as there is a stand of coaches somewhere hereabouts  had not we better take a coach  instead of walking all the way to Bristol   For a stout archer  said Mr  Gresham   you are more easily tired than one might have expected  However  with all my heart  let us take a coach  for Ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday  and I believe I should find it rather too much for me to walk so far  though I am not sick with eating good things   THE CATHEDRAL  said Hal  after he had been seated in the coach about a quarter of an hour  and had somewhat recovered from his sickness  the cathedral  Why  are we only going to Bristol to see the cathedral  I thought we came out to see about a uniform  There was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in Hal  s countenance as he pronounced these words  like one wakening from a dream  which made both his uncle and his cousin burst out a  laughing   Why  said Hal  who was now piqued   I  m sure you did say  uncle  you would go to Mr  Hall  s to choose the cloth for the uniform   Very true  and so I will  said Mr  Gresham   but we need not make a whole morning  s work  need we  of looking at a piece of cloth  Cannot we see a uniform and a cathedral both in one morning  They went first to the cathedral  Hal  s head was too full of the uniform to take any notice of the painted window  which immediately caught Ben  s embarrassed attention  He looked at the large stained figures on the Gothic window  and he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and walls  Mr  Gresham  who perceived that he was eager on all subjects to gain information  took this opportunity of telling him several things about the lost art of painting on glass  Gothic arches  etc  which Hal thought extremely tiresome   Come  come  we shall be late indeed  said Hal   surely you  ve looked long enough  Ben  at this blue and red window   I  m only thinking about these coloured shadows  said Ben   I can show you when we go home  Ben  said his uncle   an entertaining paper upon such shadows   Vide  Priestley  s History of Vision  chapter on coloured shadows   Hark  cried Ben   did you hear that noise  They all listened  and they heard a bird singing in the cathedral   It  s our old robin  sir  said the lad who had opened the cathedral door for them   Yes  said Mr  Gresham   there he is  boys  look  perched upon the organ  he often sits there  and sings  whilst the organ is playing   And  continued the lad who showed the cathedral   he has lived here these many  many winters  They say he is fifteen years old  and he is so tame  poor fellow  that if I had a bit of bread he  d come down and feed in my hand   I  ve a bit of bun here  cried Ben  joyfully  producing the remains of the bun which Hal but an hour before would have thrown away   Pray  let us see the poor robin eat out of your hand  The lad crumbled the bun  and called to the robin  who fluttered and chirped  and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread  but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ   He is afraid of US  said Ben   he is not used to eat before strangers  I suppose   Ah  no  sir  said the young man  with a deep sigh   that is not the thing  He is used enough to eat afore company  Time was he  d have come down for me before ever so many fine folks  and have eat his crumbs out of my hand  at my first call  but  poor fellow  it  s not his fault now  He does not know me now  sir  since my accident  because of this great black patch  The young man put his hand to his right eye  which was covered with a huge black patch  Ben asked what ACCIDENT he meant  and the lad told him that  but a few weeks ago  he had lost the sight of his eye by the stroke of a stone  which reached him as he was passing under the rocks at Clifton unluckily when the workmen were blasting   I don  t mind so much for myself  sir  said the lad   but I can  t work so well now  as I used to do before my accident  for my old mother  who has had a STROKE of the palsy  and I  ve a many little brothers and sisters not well able yet to get their own livelihood  though they be as willing as willing can be   Where does your mother live  said Mr  Gresham   Hard by  sir  just close to the church here  it was HER that always had the showing of it to strangers  till she lost the use of her poor limbs   Shall we  may we  uncle  go that way  This is the house  is not it  said Ben  when they went out of the cathedral  They went into the house  it was rather a hovel than a house  but  poor as it was  it was as neat as misery could make it  The old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed  winding worsted  four meagre  ill  clothed  pale children were all busy  some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin  maker  and others sorting rags for the paper  maker   What a horrid place it is  said Hal  sighing   I did not know there were such shocking places in the world  I  ve often seen terrible  looking  tumble  down places  as we drove through the town in mamma  s carriage  but then I did not know who lived in them  and I never saw the inside of any of them  It is very dreadful  indeed  to think that people are forced to live in this way  I wish mamma would send me some more pocket  money  that I might do something for them  I had half a crown  but  continued he  feeling in his pockets   I  m afraid I spent the last shilling of it this morning upon those cakes that made me sick  I wish I had my shilling now  I  d give it to these poor people  Ben  though he was all this time silent  was as sorry as his talkative cousin for all these poor people  But there was some difference between the sorrow of these two boys  Hal  after he was again seated in the hackney  coach  and had rattled through the busy streets of Bristol  for a few minutes quite forgot the spectacle of misery which he had seen  and the gay shops in Wine Street and the idea of his green and white uniform wholly occupied his imagination   Now for our uniforms  cried he  as he jumped eagerly out of the coach  when his uncle stopped at the woollen  draper  s door   Uncle  said Ben  stopping Mr  Gresham before he got out of the carriage   I don  t think a uniform is at all necessary for me  I  m very much obliged to you  but I would rather not have one  I have a very good coat  and I think it would be waste   Well  let me get out of the carriage  and we will see about it  said Mr  Gresham   perhaps the sight of the beautiful green and white cloth  and the epaulettes ( have you ever considered the epaulettes ) may tempt you to change your mind   Oh  no  said Ben  laughing   I shall not change my mind  The green cloth  and the white cloth  and the epaulettes were produced  to Hal  s infinite satisfaction  His uncle took up a pen  and calculated for a few minutes  then  showing the back of the letter  upon which he was writing  to his nephews   Cast up these sums  boys  said he   and tell me whether I am right   Ben  do you do it  said Hal  a little embarrassed   I am not quick at figures  Ben WAS  and he went over his uncle  s calculation very expeditiously   It is right  is it  said Mr  Gresham   Yes  sir  quite right   Then  by this calculation  I find I could  for less than half the money your uniforms would cost  purchase for each of you boys a warm great  coat  which you will want  I have a notion  this winter upon the Downs   Oh  sir  said Hal  with an alarmed look   but it is not winter YET  it is not cold weather YET  We sha  n  t want greatcoats YET   Don  t you remember how cold we were  Hal  the day before yesterday  in that sharp wind  when we were flying our kite upon the Downs  and winter will come  though it is not come yet  I am sure  I should like to have a good warm great  coat very much  Mr  Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them before Hal  and three before Ben   Young gentlemen  said he   I believe your uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece  Now I will lay out this money for you just as you please  Hal  what say you   Why  sir  said Hal   a great  coat is a good thing  to be sure  and then  after the great  coat  as you said it would only cost half as much as the uniform  there would be some money to spare  would not there   Yes  my dear  about five  and  twenty shillings   Five  and  twenty shillings  I could buy and do a great many things  to be sure  with five  and  twenty shillings  but then  THE THING IS  I must go without the uniform  if I have the great  coat   Certainly  said his uncle   Ah  said Hal  sighing  as he looked at the epaulettes   uncle  if you would not be displeased  if I choose the uniform   I shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you like best  said Mr  Gresham   Well  then  thank you  sir  said Hal   I think I had better have the uniform  because  if I have not the uniform  now  directly  it will be of no use to me  as the archery meeting is the week after next  you know  and  as to the great  coat  perhaps between this time and the VERY cold weather  which  perhaps  won  t be till Christmas  papa will buy a great  coat for me  and I  ll ask mamma to give me some pocket money to give away  and she will  perhaps  To all this conclusive  conditional reasoning  which depended upon the word PERHAPS  three times repeated  Mr  Gresham made no reply  but he immediately bought the uniform for Hal  and desired that it should be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes  son  s tailor  to be made up  The measure of Hal  s happiness was now complete   And how am I to lay out the three guineas for you  Ben  said Mr  Gresham   speak  what do you wish for first   A great  coat  uncle  if you please  Gresham bought the coat  and  after it was paid for  five  and  twenty shillings of Ben  s three guineas remained   What next  my boy  said his uncle   Arrows  uncle  if you please  three arrows   My dear  I promised you a bow and arrows   No  uncle  you only said a bow   Well  I meant a bow and arrows  I  m glad you are so exact  however  It is better to claim less than more than what is promised  The three arrows you shall have  But go on  how shall I dispose of these five  and  twenty shillings for you   In clothes  if you will be so good  uncle  for that poor boy who has the great black patch on his eye   I always believed  said Mr  Gresham  shaking hands with Ben   that economy and generosity were the best friends  instead of being enemies  as some silly  extravagant people would have us think them  Choose the poor  blind boy  s coat  my dear nephew  and pay for it  There  s no occasion for my praising you about the matter  Your best reward is in your own mind  child  and you want no other  or I  m mistaken  Now  jump into the coach  boys  and let  s be off  We shall be late  I  m afraid  continued he  as the coach drove on   but I must let you stop  Ben  with your goods  at the poor boy  s door  When they came to the house  Mr  Gresham opened the coach door  and Ben jumped out with his parcel under his arm   Stay  stay  you must take me with you  said his pleased uncle   I like to see people made happy  as well as you do   And so do I  too  said Hal   let me come with you  I almost wish my uniform was not gone to the tailor  s  so I do  And when he saw the look of delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes which Ben gave him  and when he heard the mother and children thank him  he sighed  and said   Well  I hope mamma will give me some more pocket money soon  Upon his return home  however  the sight of the FAMOUS bow and arrow  which Lady Diana Sweepstakes had sent him  recalled to his imagination all the joys of his green and white uniform  and he no longer wished that it had not been sent to the tailor  s   But I don  t understand  Cousin Hal  said little Patty   why you call this bow a FAMOUS bow  You say famous very often  and I don  t know exactly what it means  a famous uniform  famous doings  I remember you said there are to be famous doings  the first of September  upon the Downs  What does famous mean   Oh  why  famous means  now  don  t you know what famous means  It means   it is a word that people say  it is the fashion to say it  it means  it means famous  Patty laughed  and said   This does not explain it to me   No  said Hal   nor can it be explained  if you don  t understand it  that  s not my fault  Everybody but little children  I suppose  understands it  but there  s no explaining THOSE SORT of words  if you don  t TAKE THEM at once  There  s to be famous doings upon the Downs  the first of September  that is grand  fine  In short  what does it signify talking any longer  Patty  about the matter  Give me my bow  for I must go out upon the Downs and practise  Ben accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which his uncle had now given to him  and  every day  these two boys went out upon the Downs and practised shooting with indefatigable perseverance  Where equal pains are taken  success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal  Our two archers  by constant practice  became expert marksmen  and before the day of trial  they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity  that it was scarcely possible to decide which was superior  The long expected lst of September at length arrived   What sort of a day is it  was the first question that was asked by Hal and Ben the moment that they wakened  The sun shone bright  but there was a sharp and high wind   Ha  said Ben   I shall be glad of my good great  coat to  day  for I  ve a notion it will be rather cold upon the Downs  especially when we are standing still  as we must  whilst all the people are shooting   Oh  never mind  I don  t think I shall feel it cold at all  said Hal  as he dressed himself in his new green and white uniform  and he viewed himself with much complacency   Good morning to you  uncle  how do you do  said he  in a voice of exultation  when he entered the breakfast  room  How do you do  seemed rather to mean   How do you like me in my uniform  And his uncle  s cool   Very well  I thank you  Hal  disappointed him  as it seemed only to say   Your uniform makes no difference in my opinion of you  Even little Patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual  and talked of the pleasure of walking with her father to the Downs  and of all the little things which interested her  so that Hal  s epaulettes were not the principal object in anyone  s imagination but his own   Papa  said Patty   as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud  I must take care to pick my way nicely  and I must hold up my frock  as you desired me  and  perhaps  you will be so good  if I am not troublesome  to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping  stones  My ankle is entirely well  and I  m glad of that  or else I should not be able to walk so far as the Downs  How good you were to me  Ben  when I was in pain the day I sprained my ankle  You played at jack straws and at cat  s  cradle with me  Oh  that puts me in mind  here are your gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend  I  ve been a great while about them  but are not they not very neatly mended  papa  Look at the sewing   I am not a very good judge of sewing  my dear little girl  said Mr  Gresham  examining the work with a close and scrupulous eye   but  in my opinion  here is one stitch that is rather too long  The white teeth are not quite even   Oh  papa  I  ll take out that long tooth in a minute  said Patty  laughing   I did not think that you would observe it so soon   I would not have you trust to my blindness  said her father  stroking her head  fondly   I observe everything  I observe  for instance  that you are a grateful little girl  and that you are glad to be of use to those who have been kind to you  and for this I forgive you the long stitch   But it  s out  it  s out  papa  said Patty   and the next time your gloves want mending  Ben  I  ll mend them better   They are very nice  I think  said Ben  drawing them on   and I am much obliged to you  I was just wishing I had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers warm to  day  for I never can shoot well when my hands are benumbed  Look  Hal  you know how ragged these gloves were  you said they were good for nothing but to throw away  now look  there  s not a hole in them  said he  spreading his fingers   Now  is it not very extraordinary  said Hal to himself   that they should go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves  without saying scarcely a word about my new uniform  Well  the young Sweepstakes and Lady Diana will talk enough about it  that  s one comfort  Is not it time to think of setting out  sir  said Hal to his uncle   The company  you know  are to meet at the Ostrich at twelve  and the race to begin at one  and Lady Diana  s horses  I know were ordered to be at the door at ten  Mr  Stephen  the butler  here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in his calculations   There  s a poor lad  sir  below  with a great black patch on his right eye  who is come from Bristol  and wants to speak a word with the young gentlemen  if you please  I told him they were just going out with you  but he says he won  t detain them more than half a minute   Show him up  show him up  said Mr  Gresham   But  I suppose  said Hal  with a sigh   that Stephen mistook  when he said the young GENTLEMEN  he only wants to see Ben  I daresay  I  m sure he has no reason to want to see me   Here he comes  Oh  Ben  he is dressed in the new coat you gave him  whispered Hal  who was really a good  natured boy  though extravagant   How much better he looks than he did in the ragged coat  Ah  he looked at you first  Ben  and well he may  The boy bowed  without any cringing servility  but with an open  decent freedom in his manner  which expressed that he had been obliged  but that he knew his young benefactor was not thinking of the obligation  He made as little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins   As I was sent with a message  by the clerk of our parish  to Redland chapel out on the Downs  to  day  sir  said he to Mr  Gresham   knowing your house lay in my way  my mother  sir  bid me call  and make bold to offer the young gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked for them  continued the lad  pulling out of his pocket two worsted balls worked in green and orange  coloured stripes   They are but poor things  sir  she bid me say  to look at  but  considering she has but one hand to work with  and that her left hand  you  ll not despise  em  we hopes  He held the balls to Ben and Hal   They are both alike  gentlemen  said he   If you  ll be pleased to take  em they  re better than they look  for they bound higher than your head  I cut the cork round for the inside myself  which was all I could do   They are nice balls  indeed  we are much obliged to you  said the boys as they received them  and they proved them immediately  The balls struck the floor with a delightful sound  and rebounded higher than Mr  Gresham  s head  Little Patty clapped her hands joyfully  But now a thundering double rap at the door was heard   The Master Sweepstakes  sir  said Stephen   are come for Master Hal  They say that all the young gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to walk together  in a body  I think they say  sir  and they are to parade along the Well Walk  they desired me to say  sir  with a drum and fife  and so up the hill by Prince  s Place  and all to go upon the Downs together  to the place of meeting  I am not sure I  m right  sir  for both the young gentlemen spoke at once  and the wind is very high at the street door  so that I could not well make out all they said  but I believe this is the sense of it   Yes  yes  said Hal  eagerly   it  s all right  I know that is just what was settled the day I dined at Lady Diana  s  and Lady Diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride   Well  that is nothing to the purpose  interrupted Mr  Gresham   Don  t keep these Master Sweepstakes waiting  Decide  do you choose to go with them or with us   Sir  uncle  sir  you know  since all the UNIFORMS agreed to go together    Off with you  then  Mr  Uniform  if you mean to go  said Mr  Gresham  Hal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows  Ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own  and the lad from Bristol  who had been ordered by Mr  Gresham to eat his breakfast before he proceeded to Redland Chapel  heard Ben talking about his cousin  s bow and arrows   I know  said Ben   he will be sorry not to have his bow with him  because here are the green knots tied to it  to match his cockade  and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows  as part of the show   If you  ll give me leave  sir  said the poor Bristol lad   I shall have plenty of time  and I  ll run down to the Well Walk after the young gentleman  and take him his bow and arrows   Will you  I shall be much obliged to you  said Ben  and away went the boy with the bow that was ornamented with green ribands  The public walk leading to the Wells was full of company  The windows of all the houses in St  Vincent  s Parade were crowded with well dressed ladies  who were looking out in expectation of the archery procession  Parties of gentlemen and ladies  and a motley crowd of spectators  were seen moving backwards and forwards  under the rocks  on the opposite side of the water  A barge  with coloured streamers flying  was waiting to take up a party who were going upon the water  The bargemen rested upon their oars  and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene that appeared upon the public walk  The archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the semicircular piazza just before Mrs  Yearsley  s library  A little band of children  who had been mustered by Lady Diana Sweepstakes  SPIRITED EXERTIONS  closed the procession  They were now all in readiness  The drummer only waited for her ladyship  s signal  and the archers  corps only waited for her ladyship  s word of command to march   Where are your bow and arrows  my little man  said her ladyship to Hal  as she reviewed her Lilliputian regiment   You can  t march  man  without your arms  Hal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow  but the messenger returned not  He looked from side to side in great distress  Oh  there  s my bow coming  I declare  cried he   look  I see the bow and the ribands  Look now  between the trees  Charles Sweepstakes  on the Hotwell Walk  it is coming   But you  ve kept us all waiting a confounded time  said his impatient friend   It is that good  natured poor fellow from Bristol  I protest  that has brought it me  I  m sure I don  t deserve it from him  said Hal  to himself  when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running  quite out of breath  towards him  with his bow and arrows   Fall back  my good friend  fall back  said the military lady  as soon as he had delivered the bow to Hal   I mean  stand out of the way  for your great patch cuts no figure amongst us  Don  t follow so close  now  as if you belonged to us  pray  The poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph  he FELL BACK as soon as he understood the meaning of the lady  s words  The drum beat  the fife played  the archers marched  the spectators admired  Hal stepped proudly  and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his epaulettes  or upon the facings of his uniform  whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show  The walk appeared much shorter than usual  and he was extremely sorry that Lady Diana  when they were half  way up the hill leading to Prince  s Place  mounted her horse  because the road was dirty  and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example   We can leave the children to walk  you know  said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her horse   I must call to some of them  though  and leave orders where they are to join  She beckoned  and Hal  who was foremost  and proud to show his alacrity  ran on to receive her ladyship  s orders  Now  as we have before observed  it was a sharp and windy day  and though Lady Diana Sweepstakes was actually speaking to him  and looking at him  he could not prevent his nose from wanting to be blowed  he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left home  and which  according to his usual careless habits  he had stuffed into his pockets in his hurry   Oh  my new ball  cried he  as he ran after it  As he stopped to pick it up  he let go his hat  which he had hitherto held on with anxious care  for the hat  though it had a fine green and white cockade  had no band or string round it  The string  as we may recollect  our wasteful hero had used in spinning his top  The hat was too large for his head without this band  a sudden gust of wind blew it off  Lady Diana  s horse started and reared  She was a FAMOUS horse woman  and sat him to the admiration of all beholders  but there was a puddle of red clay and water in this spot  and her ladyship  s uniform habit was a sufferer by the accident   Careless brat  said she   why can  t he keep his hat upon his head  In the meantime  the wind blew the hat down the hill  and Hal ran after it amidst the laughter of his kind friends  the young Sweepstakes  and the rest of the little regiment  The hat was lodged  at length  upon a bank  Hal pursued it  he thought this bank was hard  but  alas  the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank  He tried to draw it back  his other foot slipped  and he fell prostrate  in his green and white uniform  into the treacherous bed of red mud  His companions  who had halted upon the top of the hill  stood laughing  spectators of his misfortune  It happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye  who had been ordered by Lady Diana to  fall back  and to  keep at a distance  was now coming up the hill  and the moment he saw our fallen hero  he hastened to his assistance  He dragged poor Hal  who was a deplorable spectacle  out of the red mud  The obliging mistress of a lodging house  as soon as she understood that the young gentleman was nephew to Mr  Gresham  to whom she had formerly let her house  received Hal  covered as he was with dirt  The poor Bristol lad hastened to Mr  Gresham  s for clean stockings and shoes for Hal  He was unwilling to give up his uniform  it was rubbed and rubbed  and a spot here and there was washed out  and he kept continually repeating  When it  s dry it will all brush off  when it  s dry it will all brush off  won  t it  But soon the fear of being too late at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in his stained habiliments  and he now as anxiously repeated  whilst the woman held the wet coat to the fire   Oh  I shall be too late  indeed  I shall be too late  make haste  it will never dry  hold it nearer  nearer to the fire  I shall lose my turn to shoot  oh  give me the coat  I don  t mind how it is  if I can but get it on  Holding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly  to be sure  but it shrunk it also  so that it was no easy matter to get the coat on again  However  Hal  who did not see the red splashes  which  in spite of all these operations  were too visible upon his shoulders  and upon the skirts of his white coat behind  was pretty well satisfied to observe that there was not one spot upon the facings   Nobody  said he   will take notice of my coat behind  I daresay  I think it looks as smart almost as ever  and under this persuasion our young archer resumed his bow  his bow with green ribands  now no more  and he pursued his way to the Downs  All his companions were far out of sight   I suppose  said he to his friend with the black patch  I suppose my uncle and Ben had left home before you went for the shoes and stockings for me   Oh  yes  sir  the butler said they had been gone to the Downs a matter of a good half  hour or more  Hal trudged on as fast as he possibly could  When he got upon the Downs  he saw numbers of carriages  and crowds of people  all going towards the place of meeting at the Ostrich  He pressed forwards  He was at first so much afraid of being late  that he did not take notice of the mirth his motley appearance excited in all beholders  At length he reached the appointed spot  There was a great crowd of people  In the midst he heard Lady Diana  s loud voice betting upon someone who was just going to shoot at the mark   So then the shooting is begun  is it  said Hal   Oh  let me in  pray let me into the circle  I  m one of the archers  I am  indeed  don  t you see my green and white uniform   Your red and white uniform  you mean  said the man to whom he addressed himself  and the people  as they opened a passage for him  could not refrain laughing at the mixture of dirt and finery which it exhibited  In vain  when he got into the midst of the formidable circle  he looked to his friends  the young Sweepstakes  for their countenance and support  They were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers  Lady Diana also seemed more to enjoy than to pity his confusion   Why could you not keep your hat upon your head  man  said she  in her masculine tone   You have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit  but I  ve escaped rather better than you have  Don  t stand there  in the middle of the circle  or you  ll have an arrow in your eyes just now  I  ve a notion  Hal looked round in search of better friends   Oh  where  s my uncle  where  s Ben  said he  He was in such confusion  that  amongst the number of faces  he could scarcely distinguish one from another  but he felt somebody at this moment pull his elbow  and  to his great relief  he heard the friendly voice  and saw the good natured face of his Cousin Ben   Come back  come behind these people  said Ben   and put on my great  coat  here it is for you  Right glad was Hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the rough great  coat which he had formerly despised  He pulled the stained  drooping cockade out of his unfortunate hat  and he was now sufficiently recovered from his vexation to give an intelligible account of his accident to his uncle and Patty  who anxiously inquired what had detained him so long  and what had been the matter  In the midst of the history of his disaster  he was just proving to Patty that his taking the hatband to spin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune  and he was at the same time endeavouring to refute his uncle  s opinion that the waste of the whipcord that tied the parcel was the original cause of all his evils  when he was summoned to try his skill with his FAMOUS bow   My hands are benumbed  I can scarcely feel  said he  rubbing them  and blowing upon the ends of his fingers   Come  come  cried young Sweepstakes   I  m within one inch of the mark  who  ll go nearer  I shall like to see  Shoot away  Hal  but first understand our laws  we settled them before you came upon the green  You are to have three shots  with your own bow and your own arrows  and nobody  s to borrow or lend under pretence of other  s bows being better or worse  or under any pretence  Do you hear  Hal  This young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws  as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself  Some of the boys had forgotten to bring more than one arrow with them  and by his cunning regulation that each person should shoot with their own arrows  many had lost one or two of their shots   You are a lucky fellow  you have your three arrows  said young Sweepstakes   Come  we can  t wait whilst you rub your fingers  man  shoot away  Hal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend spoke  He little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship  Hurried by his impatient rival  and with his hands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow in the string  he drew the bow  The arrow was within a quarter of an inch of Master Sweepstakes  mark  which was the nearest that had yet been hit  Hal seized his second arrow   If I have any luck  said he  But just as he pronounced the word LUCK  and as he bent his bow  the string broke in two  and the bow fell from his hands   There  it  s all over with you  cried Master Sweepstakes  with a triumphant laugh   Here  s my bow for him  and welcome  said Ben   No  no  sir  said Master Sweepstakes   that is not fair  that  s against the regulation  You may shoot with your own bow  if you choose it  or you may not  just as you think proper  but you must not lend it  sir  It was now Ben  s turn to make his trial  His first arrow was not successful  His second was exactly as near as Hal  s first   You have but one more  said Master Sweepstakes  now for it  Ben  before he ventured his last arrow  prudently examined the string of his bow  and  as he pulled it to try its strength  it cracked  Master Sweepstakes clapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter  But his laughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an excellent piece of whip cord   The everlasting whip cord  I declare  exclaimed Hal  when he saw that it was the very same that had tied up the parcel   Yes  said Ben  as he fastened it to his bow   I put it into my pocket  to  day  on purpose  because I thought I might happen to want it  He drew his bow the third and last time   Oh  papa  cried little Patty  as his arrow hit the mark   it  s the nearest  is it not the nearest  Master Sweepstakes  with anxiety  examined the hit  There could be no doubt  Ben was victorious  The bow  the prize bow  was now delivered to him  and Hal  as he looked at the whip  cord exclaimed   How LUCKY this whip  cord has been to you  Ben   It is LUCKY  perhaps you mean  that he took care of it  said Mr  Gresham   Ay  said Hal   very true  he might well say   Waste not  want not  It is a good thing to have two strings to one  s bow  OLD POZ  LUCY  daughter to the Justice  MRS  BUSTLE  landlady of the  Saracen  s Head  JUSTICE

Shall he come in  papa  Just  Yes  child  by all means  and now I shall hear what possessed him to leave the box  I don  t understand  there  s something deep in all this  I don  t understand it  Now

with you to the bowling  green  at the  Saracen  s Head  Land  Oh  of all days in the year  but I ask pardon  miss  Lucy  Well  that day I heard my uncle and another gentleman telling stories of magpies hiding money  and they laid a wager about this old magpie and they tried him  they put a shilling upon the table  and he ran away with it  and hid it  so I thought that he might do so again  you know  this time  Just  Right  right  It  s a pity  child  you are not upon the Bench  ha  ha  ha  Lucy  And when I went to his old hiding place  there it was  but you see  papa  he did not take

charming pie it is  and it  s on the table  Will  And Mr  Smack  the curate  and Squire Solid  and the doctor  sir  are come  and dinner is upon the table  Just  Then let us say no more  but do justice immediately to the goose  pie  and  darling  put me in mind to tell this story after dinner  ( After they go out  the Justice stops )  Tell this story  I don  t know whether it tells well for me  but I  ll never be positive any more  THAT  S POZ  THE MIMIC  CHAPTER I  Mr  and Mrs  Montague spent the summer of the year  at Clifton with their son Frederick  and their two daughters Sophia and Marianne  They had taken much care of the education of their children  nor were they ever tempted  by any motive of personal convenience or temporary amusement  to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils  Sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions  and of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters and the manners  they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view   Let children see and judge for themselves  is often inconsiderately said  Where children see only a part they cannot judge of the whole  and from the superficial view which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation  they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human happiness  a false notion of the nature of society  and false opinions of characters  For the above reasons  Mr  and Mrs  Montague were particularly cautious in the choice of their acquaintances  as they were well aware that whatever passed in conversation before children became part of their education  When they came to Clifton they wished to have a house entirely to themselves  but  as they came late in the season  almost all the lodging houses were full  and for a few weeks they were obliged to remain in a house where some of the apartments were already occupied  During the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with them  An elderly quaker  and his sister Bertha  were their silent neighbours  The blooming complexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the children  as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go out upon the Downs  They could scarcely believe that she came to the Wells on account of her health  Besides her blooming complexion  the delicate white of her garments had struck them with admiration  and they observed that her brother carefully guarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage  as he handed her in  From this circumstance  and from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman  they concluded that he was very fond of his sister  and that they were certainly very happy  except that they never spoke  and could be seen only for a moment  Not so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor  On the stairs  in the passages  at her window  she was continually visible  and she appeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once  Her voice was eternally to be heard  and it was not particularly melodious  The very first day she met Mrs  Montague  s children on the stairs  she stopped to tell Marianne that she was a charming dear  and a charming little dear  to kiss her  to inquire her name  and to inform her that her own name was  Mrs  Theresa Tattle  a circumstance of which there was little danger of their long remaining in ignorance  for  in the course of one morning  at least twenty single and as many double raps at the door were succeeded by vociferations of  Mrs  Theresa Tattle  s servant   Mrs  Theresa Tattle at home   Mrs  Theresa Tattle not at home  No person at the Wells was oftener at home and abroad than Mrs  Tattle  She had  as she deemed it  the happiness to have a most extensive acquaintance residing at Clifton  She had for years kept a register of arrivals  She regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries  and the lists at the Ball and the Pump  rooms  so that  with a memory unencumbered with literature  and free from all domestic cares  she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births  deaths and marriages  together with all the anecdotes  amusing  instructive  or scandalous  which are necessary to the conversation of a water drinking place  and essential to the character of a  very pleasant woman   A very pleasant woman  Mrs  Tattle was usually called  and  conscious of her accomplishments  she was eager to introduce herself to the acquaintance of her new neighbours  having  with her ordinary expedition  collected from their servants  by means of her own  all that could be known  or rather  all that could be told about them  The name of Montague  at all events  she knew was a good name  and justified in courting the acquaintance  She courted it first by nods  and becks and smiles at Marianne whenever she met her  and Marianne  who was a very little girl  began presently to nod and smile in return  persuaded that a lady who smiled so much  could not be ill  natured  Besides  Mrs  Theresa  s parlour door was sometimes left more than half open  to afford a view of a green parrot  Marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this door  One morning it was left quite wide open  when she stopped to say  Pretty Poll  and immediately Mrs  Tattle begged she would do her the honour to walk in and see  Pretty Poll  at the same time taking the liberty to offer her a piece of iced plum  cake  The next day Mrs  Theresa Tattle did herself the honour to wait upon Mrs  Montague   to apologize for the liberty she taken in inviting Mrs  Montague  s charming Miss Marianne into her apartment to see Pretty Poll  and for the still greater liberty she had taken in offering her a piece of plum  cake  inconsiderate creature that she was  which might possibly have disagreed with her  and which certainly were liberties she never should have been induced to take  if she had not been unaccountably bewitched by Miss Marianne  s striking though highly flattering resemblance to a young gentleman ( an officer ) with whom she had danced  now nearly twelve years ago  of the name of Montague  a most respectable young man  and of a most respectable family  with which  in a remote degree  she might presume to say  she herself was someway connected  having the honour to be nearly related to the Joneses of Merionethshire  who were cousins to the Mainwarings of Bedfordshire  who married into the family of the Griffiths  the eldest branch of which  she understood  had the honour to be cousin  german to Mr  Montague  on which account she had been impatient to pay a visit  so likely to be productive of most agreeable consequences  by the acquisition of an acquaintance whose society must do her infinite honour  Having thus happily accomplished her first visit  there seemed little probability of escaping Mrs  Tattle  s further acquaintance  In the course of the first week she only hinted to Mr  Montague that  some people thought his system of education rather odd  that she should be obliged to him if he would  some time or other  when he had nothing else to do  just sit down and make her understand his notions  that she might have something to say to her acquaintance  as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked  or any friend  s opinions  Mr  Montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say  and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened  Mrs  Tattle next addressed herself to Mrs  Montague  prophesying  in a most serious whisper   that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked  if she were not immediately provided with a back  board  a French dancing  master  and a pair of stocks  This alarming whisper could not  however  have a permanent effect upon Mrs  Montague  s understanding  because three days afterwards Mrs  Theresa  upon the most anxious inspection  entirely mistook the just and natural proportions of the hip and shoulder  This danger vanishing  Mrs  Tattle presently  with a rueful length of face  and formal preface   hesitated to assure Mrs  Montague  that she was greatly distressed about her daughter Sophy  that she was convinced her lungs were affected  and that she certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening  and above all things  must keep one of the patirosa lozenges constantly in her mouth  and directly consult Dr  Cardamum  the best physician in the world  and the person she would send for herself upon her death  bed  because  to her certain knowledge  he had recovered a young lady  a relation of her own  after she had lost one whole GLOBE  of her lungs   Lobe  The medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision could not have much weight  Neither was this universal adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to Frederick  who  she apprehended  must want some one to perfect him in the Latin and Greek  and dead languages  of which  she observed  it would be impertinent for a woman to talk  only she might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority  that a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a public school  or else from a private tutor who had been abroad ( after the advantage of a classical education  finished in one of the universities ) with a good family  without which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour  all which requisites  from personal knowledge  she could aver to be concentrated in the gentleman she had the honour to recommend  as having been tutor to a young nobleman  who had now no further occasion for him  having  unfortunately for himself and his family  been killed in an untimely duel  All Mrs  Theresa Tattle  s suggestions being lost upon these stoical parents  her powers were next tried upon the children  and her success soon became apparent  On Sophy  indeed  she could not make any impression  though she had expended on her some of her finest strokes of flattery  Sophy  though very desirous of the approbation of her friends  was not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers  She was about thirteen  that dangerous age at which ill educated girls  in their anxiety to display their accomplishments  are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor  when the habits not being formed  and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners  girls are apt to affect and imitate  indiscriminately  everything that they conceive to be agreeable  Sophy  whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers of reasoning  was not liable to fall into these errors  She found that she could please those whom she wished to please  without affecting to be anything but what she really was  and her friends listened to what she said  though she never repeated the sentiments  or adopted the phrases  which she might easily have copied from the conversation of those who were older or more fashionable than herself  This word FASHIONABLE  Mrs  Theresa Tattle knew  had usually a great effect  even at thirteen  but she had not observed that it had much power upon Sophy  nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much attended to  Her mother had taught Sophy that it was best to let herself alone  and not to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace  which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support  and which is always detected and despised by people of real good sense and politeness   Bless me  said Mrs  Tattle  to herself   if I had such a tall daughter  and so unformed  before my eyes from morning to night  it would certainly break my poor heart  Thank heaven  I am not a mother  if I were  Miss Marianne for me  Miss Marianne had heard so often from Mrs  Tattle that she was very charming  that she could not help believing it  and from being a very pleasing  unaffected little girl  she in a short time grew so conceited  that she could neither speak  look  nor be silent without imagining that everybody was  or ought to be  looking at her  and when Mrs  Theresa saw that Mrs  Montague looked very grave upon these occasions  she  to repair the ill she had done  would say  after praising Marianne  s hair or her eyes   Oh  but little ladies should never think about their beauty  you know  Nobody loves anybody for being handsome  but for being good  People must think children are very silly  or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds  if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them  by way of moral  when the countenance  manner  and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale  Children are excellent physiognomists  they quickly learn the universal language of looks  and what is said OF them always makes a greater impression than what is said TO them  a truth of which those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort themselves  and apologize to parents  by saying   Oh  but I would not say so and so to the child  Mrs  Theresa had seldom said to Frederick Montague   that he had a vast deal of drollery  and was a most incomparable mimic  but she had said so of him in whispers  which magnified the sound to his imagination  if not to his ear  He was a boy of much vivacity  and had considerable abilities  but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited  Even Mrs  Theresa Tattle  s flattery pleased him  and he exerted himself for her entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon  Instead of observing characters and manners  that he might judge of them  and form his own  he now watched every person he saw  that he might detect some foible  or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation  which he might successfully mimic  Alarmed by the rapid progress of these evils  Mr  and Mrs  Montague  who  from the first day that they had been honoured with Mrs  Tattle  s visit  had begun to look out for new lodgings  were now extremely impatient to decamp  They were not people who  from the weak fear of offending a silly acquaintance  would hazard the happiness of their family  They had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them  and they determined to go directly to look at it  As they were to be absent all day  they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children  They did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break  and therefore they only said at parting   If Mrs  Theresa Tattle should ask you to come to her  do as you think proper  Scarcely had Mrs  Montague  s carriage got out of hearing when a note was brought  directed to  Frederick Montague  Junior  Esq  which he immediately opened  and read as follows   Mrs  Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining Mr  Frederick Montague  she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening  and bring his charming sister  Miss Marianne  with him  as Mrs  Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache  and is sensible her nerves are affected  and Dr  Cardamum says that ( especially in Mrs  T  T  s case ) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant  She therefore trusts Mr  Frederick will not refuse to come and make her laugh  Mrs  Theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite  who said she was particularly fond of them the other day  Mrs  Theresa hopes they will all come at six  or before  not forgetting Miss Sophy  if she will condescend to be of the party  At the first reading of this note   the entertaining  Mr  Frederick  and the  charming  Miss Marianne laughed heartily  and looked at Sophy  as if they were afraid that she should think it possible they could like such gross flattery  but upon a second perusal  Marianne observed that it certainly was very good  natured of Mrs  Theresa to remember the macaroons  and Frederick allowed that it was wrong to laugh at the poor woman because she had the headache  Then twisting the note in his fingers  he appealed to Sophy   Well  Sophy  leave off drawing for an instant  said Frederick   and tell us what answer can we send   Can  we can send what answer we please   Yes  I know that  said Frederick   I would refuse if I could  but we ought not to do anything rude  should we  So I think we might as well go  because we could not refuse  if we would  I say   You have made such confusion  replied Sophy   between  couldn  t  and  wouldn  t  and  shouldn  t  that I can  t understand you  surely they are all different things   Different  no  cried Frederick  could  would  should  might  and ought  are all the same thing in the Latin grammar  all of  em signs of the potential mood  you know  Sophy  whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded  even by quotations from the Latin grammar  looked up soberly from her drawing  and answered  that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the Latin grammar  but she believed that they meant perfectly different things in real life   That  s just as people please  said her sophistical brother   You know words mean nothing in themselves  If I choose to call my hat my cadwallader  you would understand me just as well  after I had once explained it to you  that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I put upon my head  cadwallader and hat would then be just the same thing to you   Then why have two words for the same thing  said Sophy   and what has this to do with  could  and  should  You wanted to prove   I wanted to prove  interrupted Frederick   that it  s not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words  Do keep to the point  Sophy  and don  t dispute with me   I was not disputing  I was reasoning   Well  reasoning or disputing  Women have no business to do either  for  how should they know how to chop logic like men  At this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex  Sophy  s colour rose   There  cried Frederick  exulting   now we shall see a philosopheress in a passion  I  d give sixpence  half  price  for a harlequin entertainment  to see Sophy in a passion  Now  Marianne  look at her brush dabbing so fast in the water  Sophy  who could not easily bear to be laughed at  with some little indignation  said   Brother  I wish   There  there  cried Frederick  pointing to the colour which rose in her cheeks almost to her temples  rising  rising  rising  look at the thermometer  blood heat  blood  fever heat  boiling water heat  Marianne   Then  said Sophy  smiling   you should stand a little farther off  both of you  Leave the thermometer to itself a little while  Give it time to cool  It will come down to  temperate  by the time you look again   Oh  brother  cried Marianne   she  s so good  humoured  don  t tease her any more  and don  t draw heads upon her paper  and don  t stretch her india  rubber  and don  t let us dirty any more of her brushes  See  the sides of her tumbler are all manner of colours   Oh  I only mixed red  blue  green and yellow  to show you  Marianne  that all colours mixed together make white  But she is temperate now  and I won  t plague her  she shall chop logic  if she likes it  though she is a woman   But that  s not fair  brother  said Marianne   to say  woman  in that way  I  m sure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot  which papa showed us yesterday  long before you did  though you are a man   Not long  said Frederick   Besides  that was only a conjuring trick   It was very ingenious  though  said Marianne   and papa said so  Besides  she understood the  Rule of Three  which was no conjuring trick  better than you did  though she is a woman  and she can reason  too  mamma says   Very well  let her reason away  said the provoking wit   All I have to say is  that she  ll never be able to make a pudding   Why not  pray  brother  inquired Sophy  looking up again  very gravely   Why  you know papa himself  the other day at dinner  said that the woman who talks Greek and Latin as well as I do  is a fool after all  and that she had better have learned something useful  and Mrs  Tattle said  she  d answer for it she did not know how to make a pudding   Well  but I am not talking Greek and Latin  am I   No  but you are drawing  and that  s the same thing   The same thing  Oh  Frederick  said little Marianne  laughing   You may laugh  but I say it is the same sort of thing  Women who are always drawing and reasoning  never know how to make puddings  Mrs  Theresa Tattle said so  when I showed her Sophy  s beautiful drawing yesterday   Mrs  Theresa Tattle might say so  replied Sophy  calmly   but I do not perceive the reason  brother  why drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a pudding   Well  I say you  ll never learn how to make a good pudding   I have learned  continued Sophy  who was mixing her colours   to mix such and such colours together to make the colour that I want  and why should I not be able to learn to mix flour and butter  and sugar and egg  together  to produce the taste that I want   Oh  but mixing will never do  unless you know the quantities  like a cook  and you would never learn the right quantities   How did the cook learn them  Cannot I learn them as she did   Yes  but you  d never do it exactly  and mind the spoonfuls right  by the recipe  like a cook   Indeed  indeed  but she would  cried Marianne  eagerly   and a great deal more exactly  for mamma has taught her to weigh and measure things very carefully  and when I was ill she always weighed the bark in nicely  and dropped my drops so carefully  better than the cook  When mamma took me down to see the cook make a cake once  I saw her spoonfuls  and her ounces  and her handfuls  she dashed and splashed without minding exactness or the recipe  or anything  I  m sure Sophy would make a much better pudding  if exactness only were wanting   Well  granting that she could make the best pudding in the whole world  what does that signify  I say she never would  so it comes to the same thing   Never would  how can you tell that  brother   Why  now look at her  with her books  and her drawings  and all this apparatus  Do you think she would ever jump up  with all her nicety  too  and put by all these things  to go down into the greasy kitchen  and plump up to the elbows in suet  like a cook  for a plum  pudding   I need not plump up to the elbows  brother  said Sophy  smiling   nor is it necessary that I should be a cook  but  if it were necessary  I hope I should be able to make a pudding   Yes  yes  cried Marianne  warmly   and she would jump up  and put by all her things in a minute if it were necessary  and run down stairs and up again like lightning  or do anything that was ever so disagreeable to her  even about the suet  with all her nicety  brother  I assure you  as she used to do anything  everything for me  when I was ill last winter  Oh  brother  she can do anything  and she could make the best plum  pudding in the whole world  I  m sure  in a minute  if it were necessary  CHAPTER II  A knock at the door  from Mrs  Theresa Tattle  s servant  recalled Marianne to the business of the day   There  said Frederick   we have sent no answer all this time  It  s necessary to think of that in a minute  The servant came with his mistress  compliments  to let the young ladies and Mr  Frederick know that she was waiting tea for them   Waiting  then we must go  said Frederick  The servant opened the door wider  to let him pass  and Marianne thought she must follow her brother  so they went downstairs together  while Sophy gave her own message to the servant  and quietly stayed at her usual occupations  Mrs  Tattle was seated at her tea  table  with a large plate of macaroons beside her when Frederick and Marianne entered  She was  delighted  they were come  and  grieved  not to see Miss Sophy along with them  Marianne coloured a little  for though she had precipitately followed her brother  and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying  You know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best  yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself  and it was not till after Mrs  Theresa had exhausted all her compliments  and half her macaroons  that she could restore her spirits to their usual height   Come  Mr  Frederick  said she after tea   you promised to make me laugh  and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself   Oh  brother  said Marianne   show Mrs  Theresa Dr  Carbuncle eating his dinner  and I  ll be Mrs  Carbuncle  Marianne  Now  my dear  what shall I help you to  Frederick   My dear  she never calls him my dear  you know  but always Doctor  Mar  Well then  doctor  what will you eat to  day  Fred  Eat  madam  eat  nothing  nothing  I don  t see anything here I can eat  ma  am  Mar  Here  s eels  sir  let me help you to some eel  stewed eel  you used to be fond of stewed eel  Fred  Used  ma  am  used  But I  m sick of stewed eels  You would tire one of anything  Am I to see nothing but eels  And what  s this at the bottom  Mar  Mutton  doctor  roast mutton  if you  ll be so good as to cut it  Fred  Cut it  ma  am  I can  t cut it  I say  it  s as hard as a deal board  You might as well tell me to cut the table  ma  am  Mutton  indeed  not a bit of fat  Roast mutton  indeed  not a drop of gravy  Mutton  truly  quite a cinder  I  ll have none of it  Here  take it away  take it downstairs to the cook  It  s a very hard case  Mrs  Carbuncle  that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat at my own table  Mrs  Carbuncle  since I was married  ma  am  I that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner  It  s really very extraordinary  Mrs  Carbuncle  What have you at that corner there  under the cover  Mar  Patties  sir  oyster patties  Fred  Patties  ma  am  kickshaws  I hate kickshaws  Not worth putting under a cover  ma  am  And why not have glass covers  that one may see one  s dinner before one  before it grows cold with asking questions  Mrs  Carbuncle  and lifting up covers  But nobody has any sense  and I see no water plates anywhere  lately  Mar  Do  pray  doctor  let me help you to a bit of chicken before it gets cold  my dear  Fred  ( aside )  My dear  again  Marianne  Mar  Yes  brother  because she is frightened  you know  and Mrs  Carbuncle always says  my dear  to him when she  s frightened  and looks so pale from side to side  and sometimes she cries before dinner  s done  and then all the company are quite silent  and don  t know what to do   Oh  such a little creature  to have so much sense  too  exclaimed Mrs  Theresa  with rapture   Mr  Frederick  you  ll make me die with laughing  Pray go on  Dr  Carbuncle  Fred  Well  ma  am  then if I must eat something  send me a bit of fowl  a leg and wing  the liver wing  and a bit of the breast  oyster sauce  and a slice of that ham  if you please  ma  am  ( Dr  Carbuncle eats voraciously  with his head down to his plate  and  dropping the sauce  he buttons up his coat tight across the breast ) Fred  Here  a plate  knife and fork  bit o  bread  a glass of Dorchester ale   Oh  admirable  exclaimed Mrs  Tattle  clapping her hands   Now  brother  suppose that it is after dinner  said Marianne   and show us how the doctor goes to sleep  Frederick threw himself back in an arm  chair  leaning his head back  with his mouth open  snoring  nodded from time to time  crossed and uncrossed his legs  tried to awake himself by twitching his wig  settling his collar  blowing his nose and rapping on the lid of his snuff  box  All which infinitely diverted Mrs  Tattle  who  when she could stop herself from laughing  declared  It made her sigh  too  to think of the life poor Mrs  Carbuncle led with that man  and all for nothing  too  for her jointure was nothing  next to nothing  though a great thing  to be sure  her friends thought for her  when she was only Sally Ridgeway before she was married  Such a wife as she makes  continued Mrs  Theresa  lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven   and so much as she has gone through  the brute ought to be ashamed of himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his will  for turn it which way she will  she can never keep a carriage  or live like anybody else  on her jointure  after all  she tells me  poor soul  A sad prospect  after her husband  s death  to look forward to  instead of being comfortable  as her friends expected  and she  poor young thing  knowing no better when they married her  People should look into these things  beforehand  or never marry at all  I say  Miss Marianne  Miss Marianne  who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure  or the reason why Mrs  Carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husband  s death  turned to Frederick  who was at that instant studying Mrs  Theresa as a future character to mimic   Brother  said Marianne   now sing an Italian song for us like Miss Croker  Pray  Miss Croker  favour us with a song  Mrs  Theresa Tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing  she  s quite impatient to hear you sing   Yes  indeed  I am  said Mrs  Theresa  Frederick put his hands before him affectedly   Oh  indeed  ma  am  indeed  ladies  I really am so hoarse  it distresses me so to be pressed to sing  besides  upon my word  I have quite left off singing  I  ve never sung once  except for very particular people  this winter  Mar  But Mrs  Theresa Tattle is a very particular person  I  m sure you  ll sing for her  Fred  Certainly  ma  am  I allow that you use a powerful argument  but I assure you now  I would do my best to oblige you  but I absolutely have forgotten all my English songs  Nobody hears anything but Italian now  and I have been so giddy as to leave my Italian music behind me  Besides  I make it a rule never to hazard myself without an accompaniment  Mar  Oh  try  Miss Croker  for once  [ Frederick sings  after much preluding ] Violante in the pantry  Gnawing of a mutton  bone  How she gnawed it  How she claw  d it  When she found herself alone   Charming  exclaimed Mrs  Tattle   so like Miss Croker  I  m sure I shall think of you  Mr  Frederick  when I hear her asked to sing again  Her voice  however  introduces her to very pleasant parties  and she  s a girl that  s very much taken notice of  and I don  t doubt will go off vastly well  She  s a particular favourite of mine  you must know  and I mean to do her a piece of service the first opportunity  by saying something or other  that shall go round to her relations in Northumberland  and make them do something for her  as well they may  for they are all rolling in gold  and won  t give her a penny  Mar  Now  brother  read the newspaper like Counsellor Puff   Oh  pray do  Mr  Frederick  for I declare I admire you of all things  You are quite yourself to  night  Here  s a newspaper  sir  pray let us have Counsellor Puff  It  s not late  [ Frederick reads in a pompous voice ]  As a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament in either sex  Messrs  Valiant and Wise conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of Great Britain in general  and their friends in particular  that they have now ready for sale  as usual  at the Hippocrates  Head  a fresh assortment of new  invented  much admired  primrose soap  To prevent impositions and counterfeits  the public are requested to take notice  that the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on the outside   Valiant and Wise   Oh  you most incomparable mimic   tis absolutely the counsellor himself  I absolutely must show you  some day  to my friend Lady Battersby  you  d absolutely make her die with laughing  and she  d quite adore you  said Mrs  Theresa  who was well aware that every pause must be filled with flattery   Pray go on  pray go on  I shall never be tired  if I sit looking at you these hundred years  Stimulated by these plaudits  Frederick proceeded to show how Colonel Epaulette blew his nose  flourished his cambric handkerchief  bowed to Lady Diana Periwinkle  and admired her work  saying   Done by no hands  as you may guess  but those of Fairly Fair  Whilst Lady Diana  he observed  simpered so prettily  and took herself so quietly for Fairly Fair  not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own nails all the while  Next to Colonel Epaulette  Frederick  at Marianne  s particular desire  came into the room like Sir Charles Slang   Very well  brother  cried she   your hand down to the very bottom of your pocket  and your other shoulder up to your ear  but you are not quite wooden enough  and you should walk as if your hip were out of joint  There now  Mrs  Tattle  are not those good eyes  They stare so like his  without seeming to see anything all the while   Excellent  admirable  Mr  Frederick  I must say that you are the best mimic of your age I ever saw  and I  m sure Lady Battersby will think so too  That is Sir Charles to the very life  But with all that  you must know he  s a mighty pleasant  fashionable young man when you come to know him  and has a great deal of sense under all that  and is of a very good family  the Slangs  you know  Sir Charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year  if he can keep clear of gambling  which I hear is his foible  poor young man  Pray go on  I interrupt you  Mr  Frederick   Now  brother  said Marianne   No  Marianne  I can do no more  I  m quite tired  and I will do no more  said Frederick  stretching himself at full length upon a sofa  Even in the midst of laughter  and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear  Frederick felt sad  displeased with himself  and disgusted with Mrs  Theresa   What a deep sigh was there  said Mrs  Theresa   what can make you sigh so bitterly  You  who make everybody else laugh  Oh  such another sigh again   Marianne  cried Frederick   do you remember the man in the mask   What man in the mask  brother   The man  the actor  the buffoon  that my father told us of  who used to cry behind the mask that made everybody else laugh   Cry  bless me  said Mrs  Theresa   mighty odd  very extraordinary  but one can  t be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people  actors by profession  you know  for they are brought up from the egg to make their fortune  or at least their bread by their oddities  But  my dear Mr  Frederick  you are quite pale  quite exhausted  no wonder  what will you have  a glass of cowslip  wine   Oh no  thank you  ma  am  said Frederick   Oh yes  indeed you must not leave me without taking something  and Miss Marianne must have another macaroon  I insist upon it  said Mrs  Theresa  ringing the bell   It is not late  and my man Christopher will bring up the cowslip  wine in a minute   But  Sophy  and papa and mamma  you know  will come home presently  said Marianne   Oh  Miss Sophy has her books and drawings  You know she  s never afraid of being alone  Besides  to  night it was her own choice  And as to your papa and mamma  they won  t be home to  night  I  m pretty sure  for a gentleman  who had it from their own authority  told me where they were going  which is further off than they think  but they did not consult me  and I fancy they  ll be obliged to sleep out  so you need not be in a hurry about them  We  ll have candles  The door opened just as Mrs  Tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip  wine   Christopher  Christopher  said Mrs  Theresa  who was standing at the fire  with her back to the door  when it opened   Christopher  pray bring  Do you hear  but no Christopher answered  and  upon turning round  Mrs  Tattle  instead of Christopher  beheld two little black figures  which stood perfectly still and silent  It was so dark  that their forms could scarcely be discerned   In the name of heaven  who and what may you be  Speak  I conjure you  what are ye   The chimney  sweepers  ma  am  an  please your ladyship   Chimney  sweepers  repeated Frederick and Marianne  bursting out a  laughing   Chimney  sweepers  repeated Mrs  Theresa  provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to them   Chimney  sweepers  and could not you say so a little sooner  Pray  what brings you here  gentlemen  at this time of night   The bell rang  ma  am  answered a squeaking voice   The bell rang  yes  for Christopher  The boy  s mad  or drunk   Ma  am  said the tallest of the chimney  sweepers  who had not yet spoken  and who now began in a very blunt manner   ma  am  your brother desired us to come up when the bell rang  so we did   My brother  I have no brother  dunce  said Mrs  Theresa   Mr  Eden  madam   Ho  ho  said Mrs  Tattle  in a more complacent tone   the boy takes me for Miss Bertha Eden  I perceive  and  flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney  sweeper for a young and handsome lady  Mrs  Theresa laughed  and informed him  that they had mistaken the room  and they must go up another pair of stairs  and turn to the left  The chimney  sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed  thanked her ladyship for this information  said   Good night to ye  quality  and they both moved towards the door   Stay  said Mrs  Tattle  whose curiosity was excited   what can the Edens want with chimney  sweepers at this time o  night  I wonder  Christopher  did you hear anything about it  said the lady to her footman  who was now lighting the candles   Upon my word  ma  am  said the servant   I can  t say  but I  ll step down below and inquire  I heard them talking about it in the kitchen  but I only got a word here and there  for I was hunting for the snuff  dish  as I knew it must be for candles when I heard the bell ring  ma  am  so I thought to find the snuff  dish before I answered the bell  for I knew it must be for candles you rang  But  if you please  I  ll step down now  ma  am  and see about the chimney  sweepers   Yes  step down  do  and  Christopher  bring up the cowslip  wine  and some more macaroons for my little Marianne  Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs  Tattle was going to give her  for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman  She had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and mother  and she did not like them   Well  said Mrs  Tattle to Christopher  who was now returned   what is the news   Ma  am  the little fellow with the squeaking voice has been telling me the whole story  The other morning  ma  am  early  he and the other were down the hill sweeping in Paradise Row  Those chimneys  they say  are difficult  and the square fellow  ma  am  the biggest of the two boys  got wedged in the chimney  The other little fellow was up at the top at the time  and he heard the cry  but in his fright  and all  he did not know what to do  ma  am  for he looked about from the top of the chimney  and not a soul could he see stirring  but a few that he could not make attend to his screech  the boy within almost stifling too  So he screeched  and screeched  all he could  and by the greatest chance in life  ma  am  old Mr  Eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk   Ay  interrupted Mrs  Theresa   friend Ephraim is one of your early risers   Well  said Marianne  impatiently   So  ma  am  hearing the screech  he turns and sees the sweep  and at once he understands the matter   I  m sure he must have taken some time to understand it  interposed Mrs  Tattle   for he  s the slowest creature breathing  and the deafest in company  Go on  Christopher  So the sweep did make him hear   So he says  ma  am  and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney  with much ado  ma  am   Bless me  exclaimed Mrs  Theresa   but did old Eden go up the chimney himself after the boy  wig and all   Why  ma  am  said Christopher  with a look of great delight   that was all as one  as the very  dentical words I put to the boy myself  when he telled me his story  But  ma  am  that was what I couldn  t get out of him  neither  rightly  for he is a churl  the big boy that was stuck in the chimney  I mean  for when I put the question to him about the wig  laughing like  he wouldn  t take it laughing like at all  but would only make answer to us like a bear   He saved my life  that  s all I know  and this over again  ma  am  to all the kitchen round  that cross  questioned him  But I finds him stupid and ill  mannered like  for I offered him a shilling  ma  am  myself  to tell about the wig  but he put it back in a way that did not become such as he  to no lady  s butler  ma  am  whereupon I turns to the slim fellow ( and he  s smarterer  and more mannerly  ma  am  with a tongue in his head for his betters ) but he could not resolve me my question either  for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o  the time  and when he came down Mr  Eden had his wig on  but had his arm all bare and bloody  ma  am   Poor Mr  Eden  exclaimed Marianne   Oh  miss  continued the servant   and the chimney  sweep himself was so bruised  and must have been killed   Well  well  but he  s alive now  go on with your story  Christopher  said Mrs  T   Chimney  sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day  it  s part of their trade  and it  s a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises  To be sure  added she  observing that both Frederick and Marianne looked displeased at this speech   to be sure  if one may believe this story  there was some real danger   This atrocious practice is now happily superseded by the use of sweeping machines   Real danger  yes  indeed  said Marianne   and I  m sure I think Mr  Eden was very good   Certainly it was a most commendable action  and quite providential  So I shall take an opportunity of saying  when I tell the story in all companies  and the boy may thank his kind stars  I  m sure  to the end of his days  for such an escape  But pray  Christopher  said she  persisting in her conversation with Christopher  who was now laying the cloth for supper   pray  which house was it in Paradise Row  where the Eagles or the Miss Ropers lodge  or which   It was at my Lady Battersby  s  ma  am   Ha  ha  cried Mrs  Theresa   I thought we should get to the bottom of the affair at last  This is excellent  This will make an admirable story for my Lady Battersby the next time I see her  These Quakers are so sly  Old Eden  I know  has long wanted to obtain an introduction into that house  and a charming charitable expedient hit upon  My Lady Battersby will enjoy this  of all things  CHAPTER III   Now  continued Mrs  Theresa  turning to Frederick  as soon as the servant had left the room   now  Mr  Frederick Montague  I have a favour   such a favour  to ask of you  it  s a favour which only you can grant  you have such talents  and would do the thing so admirably  and my Lady Battersby would quite adore you for it  She will do me the honour to be here to spend an evening to  morrow  I  m convinced Mr  and Mrs  Montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another day  and I so long to show you off to her ladyship  and your Doctor Carbuncle  and your Counsellor Puff  and your Miss Croker  and all your charming characters  You must let me introduce you to her ladyship to  morrow evening  Promise me   Oh  ma  am  said Frederick   I cannot promise you any such thing  indeed  I am much obliged to you  but indeed I cannot come   Why not  my dear sir  why not  You don  t think I mean you should promise  if you are certain your papa and mamma will be home   If they do come home  I will ask them about it  said Frederick  hesitating  for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation  he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying No   Ask them  repeated Mrs  Theresa   My dear sir  at your age  must you ask your papa and mamma about such things   Must  no  ma  am  said Frederick   but I said I would  I know I need not  because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost about everything   And about this  I am sure  cried Marianne   Papa and mamma  you know  just as they were going away  said   If Mrs  Theresa asks you to come  do as you think best   Well  then  said Mrs  Theresa   you know it rests with yourselves  if you may do as you please   To be sure I may  madam  said Frederick  colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame  and which often conquers real shame   to be sure  ma  am  I may do as I please   Then I may make sure of you  said Mrs  Theresa   for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you won  t do as she pleases  Mr  Frederick Montague  I  m sure  is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so unpolite  so ungallant a thing  The jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense  A new and unintelligible system is presented to them  in a language foreign to their understanding  and contradictory to their feelings  They hesitate between new motives and old principles  From the fear of being thought ignorant  they become affected  and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools  But all this they feel only when they are in the company of such people as Mrs  Theresa Tattle   Ma  am  Frederick began   I don  t mean to be rude  but I hope you  ll excuse me from coming to drink tea with you to  morrow  because my father and mother are not acquainted with Lady Battersby  and maybe they might not like   Take care  take care  said Mrs  Theresa  laughing at his perplexity   you want to get off from obliging me  and you don  t know how  You had very nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor Lady Battersby  Now you know it  s impossible that Mr  and Mrs  Montague could have in nature the slightest objection to introducing you to my Lady Battersby at my own house  for  don  t you know  that  besides her ladyship  s many unquestionable qualities  which one need not talk of  she is cousin  but once removed  to the Trotters of Lancashire  your mother  s great favourites  And there is not a person at the Wells  I  ll venture to say  could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy  in the way of partners  when she comes to go the balls  which it  s to be supposed she will  some time or other  and as you are so good a brother  that  s a thing to be looked to  you know  Besides  as to yourself  there  s nothing her ladyship delights in so much as in a good mimic  and she  ll quite adore you   But I don  t want her to adore me  ma  am  said Frederick  bluntly  then  correcting himself  added   I mean for being a mimic   Why not  my love  Between friends  can there be any harm in showing one  s talents  You that have such talents to show  She  ll keep your secret  I  ll answer for her  and  added she   you needn  t be afraid of her criticism  for  between you and me  she  s no great critic  so you  ll come  Well  thank you  that  s settled  How you have made me beg and pray  but you know your own value  I see  as you entertaining people always do  One must ask a wit  like a fine singer  so often  Well  but now for the favour I was going to ask you  Frederick looked surprised  for he thought that the favour of his company was what she meant  but she explained herself farther   As to the old Quaker who lodges above  old Ephraim Eden  my Lady Battersby and I have so much diversion about him  He is the best character  the oddest creature  If you were but to see him come into the rooms with those stiff skirts  or walking with his eternal sister Bertha  and his everlasting broad  brimmed hat  One knows him a mile off  But then his voice and way  and altogether  if one could get them to the life  they  d be better than anything on the stage  better even than anything I  ve seen to  night  and I think you  d make a capital Quaker for my Lady Battersby  but then the thing is  one can never get to hear the old quiz talk  Now you  who have so much invention and cleverness  I have no invention myself  but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him  so that you might get him by heart  I  m sure you  who are so quick  would only want to see him  and hear him  for half a minute  to be able to take him off  so as to kill one with laughing  But I have no invention   Oh  as to the invention  said Frederick   I know an admirable way of doing the thing  if that is all  but then remember  I don  t say I will do the thing  for I will not  But I know a way of getting up into his room  and seeing him  without his knowing me to be there   Oh  tell it me  you charming  clever creature   But  remember  I do not say I will do it   Well  well  let us hear it  and you shall do as you please afterwards  Merciful goodness  exclaimed Mrs  Tattle   do my ears deceive me  I declare I looked round  and thought I heard the squeaking chimney  sweeper was in the room   So did I  Frederick  I declare  cried Marianne  laughing   I never heard anything so like his voice in my life  Frederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney  sweeper to great perfection   Now  continued he   this fellow is just my height  The old Quaker  if my face were blackened  and if I were to change clothes with the chimney  sweeper  I  ll answer for it  would never know me   Oh  it  s an admirable invention  I give you infinite credit for it  exclaimed Mrs  Theresa   It shall  it must be done  I  ll ring  and have the fellow up this minute   Oh  no  do not ring  said Frederick  stopping her hand   I don  t mean to do it  You know you promised that I should do as I pleased  I only told you my invention   Well  well  but only let me ring  and ask whether the chimney  sweepers are below  You shall do as you please afterwards   Christopher  shut the door  Christopher  said she to the servant who came up when she rang   pray are the sweeps gone yet   No  ma  am   But have they been up to old Eden yet   Oh  no  ma  am  nor be not to go till the bell rings  for Miss Bertha  ma  am  was asleep a  lying down  and her brother wouldn  t have her wakened on no account whatsomever  He came down hisself to the kitchen to the sweeps  though  but wouldn  t have  as I heard him say  his sister waked for no account  But Miss Bertha  s bell will ring when she wakens for the sweeps  ma  am   Twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved  and I suppose sent for him to give him something charitable  ma  am   Well  never mind your suppositions  said Mrs  Theresa   run down this very minute to the little squeaking chimney  sweep  and send him up to me  Quick  but don  t let the other bear come up with him  Christopher  who had curiosity  as well as his mistress  when he returned with the chimney  sweeper  prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth  throwing down the tongs and shovel  and picking them up again   That will do  Christopher  Christopher  that will do  I say  Mrs  Theresa repeated in vain  She was obliged to say   Christopher  you may go  before he would depart   Now  said she to Frederick   step in here to the next room with this candle  and you  ll be equipped in an instant  Only just change clothes with the boy  only just let me see what a charming chimney  sweeper you  d make  You shall do as you please afterwards   Well  I  ll only change clothes with him  just to show you for one minute   But  said Marianne to Mrs  Theresa whilst Frederick was changing his clothes   I think Frederick is right about   About what  love   I think he is in the right not to go up  though he can do it so easily  to see that gentleman  I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards  I don  t think that would be quite right   Why  pray  Miss Marianne   Why  because he is so good  natured to his sister  He would not let her be wakened   Dear  it  s easy to be good in such little things  and he won  t have long to be good to her neither  for I don  t think she will trouble him long in this world  anyhow   What do you mean  said Marianne   That she  ll die  child   Die  die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks  How sorry her poor  poor brother will be  But she will not die  I  m sure  for she walks about and runs upstairs so lightly  Oh  you must be quite mistaken  I hope   If I  m mistaken  Dr  Panado Cardamum  s mistaken too  then  that  s my comfort  He says  unless the waters work a miracle  she stands a bad chance  and she won  t follow my advice  and consult the doctor for her health   He would frighten her to death  perhaps  said Marianne   I hope Frederick won  t go up to disturb her   Lud  child  you are turned simpleton all of a sudden  how can your brother disturb her more than the real chimney  sweeper   But I don  t think it  s right  persisted Marianne   and I shall tell him so   Nay  Miss Marianne  I don  t commend you now  Young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked  and I presume that Mr  Frederick and I must know what  s right as well as Miss Marianne  Hush  here he is  Oh  the capital figure  cried Mrs  Theresa   Bravo  bravo  cried she  as Frederick entered in the chimney  sweeper  s dress  and as he spoke  saying   I  m afraid  please your ladyship  to dirt your ladyship  s carpet  she broke out into immoderate raptures  calling him  her charming chimney  sweeper  and repeating that she knew beforehand the character would do for him  Mrs  Theresa instantly rang the bell  in spite of all expostulation  ordered Christopher to send up the other chimney  sweeper  triumphed in observing that Christopher did not know Frederick when he came into the room  and offered to lay any wager that the other chimney  sweeper would mistake him for his companion  And so he did  and when Frederick spoke  the voice was so very like  that it was scarcely possible that he should have perceived the difference  Marianne was diverted by this scene  but she started  when in the midst of it they heard a bell ring   That  s the lady  s bell  and we must go  said the blunt chimney  sweeper   Go  then  about your business  said Mrs  Theresa   and here  s a shilling for you  to drink  my honest fellow  I did not know you were so much bruised when I first saw you  I won  t detain you  Go  said she  pushing Frederick towards the door  Marianne sprang forward to speak to him  but Mrs  Theresa kept her off  and  though Frederick resisted  the lady shut the door upon him by superior force  and  having locked it  there was no retreat  Mrs  Tattle and Marianne waited impatiently for Frederick  s return   I hear them  cried Marianne   I hear them coming downstairs  They listened again  and all was silent  At length they suddenly heard a great noise of many steps in the hall   Merciful  exclaimed Mrs  Theresa   it must be your father and mother come back  Marianne ran to unlock the room door  and Mrs  Theresa followed her into the hall  The hall was rather dark  but under the lamp a crowd of people  all the servants in the house having gathered together  As Mrs  Theresa approached  the crowd opened in silence  and in the midst she beheld Frederick  with blood streaming from his face  His head was held by Christopher  and the chimney  sweeper was holding a basin for him   Merciful  what will become of me  exclaimed Mrs  Theresa   Bleeding  he  ll bleed to death  Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute  A key  a large key down his back  a key  has nobody a key  Mr  and Mrs  Montague will be here before he has done bleeding  A key  cobwebs  a puff ball  for mercy  s sake  Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute  Gracious me  he  ll bleed to death  I believe   He  ll bleed to death  Oh  my brother  cried Marianne  catching hold of the words  and terrified  she ran upstairs  crying   Sophy  oh  Sophy  come down this minute  or he  ll be dead  My brother  s bleeding to death  Sophy  Sophy  come down  or he  ll be dead   Let go the basin  you  said Christopher  pulling the basin out of the chimney  sweeper  s hand  who had all this time stood in silence   you are not fit to hold the basin for a gentleman   Let him hold it  said Frederick   he did not mean to hurt me   That  s more than he deserves  I  m certain sure he might have known well enough it was Mr  Frederick all the time  and he  d no business to go to fight  such a one as he  with a gentleman   I did not know he was a gentleman  said the chimney  sweeper   how could I   How could he  indeed  said Frederick   he shall hold the basin   Gracious me  I  m glad to hear him speak like himself again  at anyrate  cried Mrs  Theresa   And here comes Miss Sophy  too   Sophy  cried Frederick   Oh  Sophy  don  t you come  don  t look at me  you  ll despise me   My brother  where  where  said Sophy  looking  as she thought  at the two chimney  sweepers   It  s Frederick  said Marianne   that  s my brother   Miss Sophy  don  t be alarmed  Mrs  Theresa began   but gracious goodness  I wish Miss Bertha  At this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the stairs  she passed swiftly on  whilst everyone gave way before her   Oh  Miss Bertha  cried Mrs  Theresa  catching hold of her gown to stop her  as she came near Frederick   Oh  Miss Eden  your beautiful India muslin  take care of the chimney sweeper  for heaven  s sake  But she pressed forward   It  s my brother  will he die  cried Marianne  throwing her arms round her  and looking up as if to a being of a superior order   Will he bleed to death   No  my love  answered a sweet voice   do not frighten thyself   I  ve done bleeding  said Frederick   Dear me  Miss Marianne  if you would not make such a rout  cried Mrs  Tattle   Miss Bertha  it  s nothing but a frolic  You see Mr  Frederick Montague only in a masquerade dress  Nothing in the world but a frolic  ma  am  You see he  s stopped bleeding  I was frightened out of my wits at first  I thought it was his eye  but I see it  s only his nose  All  s well that ends well  Mr  Frederick  we  ll keep your counsel  Pray  ma  am  let us ask no questions  it  s only a boyish frolic  Come  Mr  Frederick  this way  into my room  and I  ll give you a towel and some clean water  and you can get rid of this masquerade dress  Make haste  for fear your father and mother should drop in upon us   Do not be afraid of thy father and mother  They are surely thy best friends  said a voice  It was the voice of an elderly gentleman  who now stood behind Frederick   Oh  sir  oh  Mr  Eden  said Frederick  turning to him   Don  t betray me  for goodness  sake  whispered Mrs  Tattle   say nothing about me   I  m not thinking about you  Let me speak  cried he  pushing away her hand  which stopped his mouth   I shall say nothing about you  I promise you  said Frederick  with a look of contempt   No  but for your own sake  my dear sir  your papa and mamma  Bless me  is not that Mrs  Montague  s carriage   My brother  ma  am  said Sophy   is not afraid of my father and mother  s coming back  Let him speak  he was going to speak the truth   To be sure  Miss Sophia  I wouldn  t hinder him from speaking the truth  but it  s not proper  I presume  ma  am  to speak truth at all times  and in all places  and before everybody  servants and all  I only wanted  ma  am  to hinder your brother from exposing himself  A hall  I apprehend  is not a proper place for explanation   Here  said Mr  Eden  opening the door of his room  which was on the opposite side of the hall to Mrs  Tattle  s   Here is a place  said he to Frederick   where thou mayst speak the truth at all times  and before everybody   Nay  my room  s at Mr  Frederick Montague  s service  and my door  s open too  This way  pray  said she  pulling his arm  But Frederick broke from her  and followed Mr  Eden   Oh  sir  will you forgive me  cried he   Forgive thee  and what have I to forgive   Forgive  brother  without asking what  said Bertha  smiling   He shall know all  cried Frederick   all that concerns myself  I mean  Sir  I disguised myself in this dress  I came up to your room to  night on purpose to see you  without your knowing it  that I might mimic you  The chimney  sweeper  where is he  said Frederick  looking round  and he ran into the hall to see for him   May he come in  he may  he is a brave  an honest  good  grateful boy  He never guessed who I was  After we left you we went down to the kitchen together  and there  fool as I was  for the pleasure of making Mr  Christopher and the servants laugh  began to mimic you  This boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at  that you had saved his life  that I ought to be ashamed of myself  that you had just given me half a crown  and so you had  but I went on  and told him I  d knock him down if he said another word  He did  I gave the first blow  we fought  I came to the ground  the servants pulled me up again  They found out  I don  t know how  that I was not a chimney  sweeper  The rest you saw  And now can you forgive me  sir  said Frederick to Mr  Eden  seizing hold of his hand   The other hand  friend  said the Quaker  gently withdrawing his right hand  which everybody now observed was much swelled  and putting it into his bosom again   This  and welcome  offering his other hand to Frederick  and shaking his with a smile   Oh  that other hand  said Frederick   that was hurt  I remember  How ill I have behaved  extremely ill  But this is a lesson that I shall never forget as long as I live  I hope for the future I shall behave like a gentleman   And like a man  and like a good man  I am sure thou wilt  said the good Quaker  shaking Frederick  s hand affectionately   or I am much mistaken  friend  in that black countenance   You are not mistaken  cried Marianne   Frederick will never be persuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right  and now  brother  you may wash your black countenance  Just when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance  a double knock was heard at the door  It was Mr  and Mrs  Montague   What will you do now  whispered Mrs  Theresa to Frederick  as his father and mother came into the room   A chimney  sweeper covered with blood  exclaimed Mr  and Mrs  Montague   Father  I am Frederick  said he  stepping forward towards them  as they stood in astonishment   Frederick  my son   Yes  mother  I  m not hurt half so much as I deserve  I  ll tell you   Nay  interrupted Bertha   let my brother tell the story this time  Thou hast told it once  and told it well  no one but my brother could tell it better   A story never tells so well the second time  to be sure  said Mrs  Theresa   but Mr  Eden will certainly make the best of it  Without taking any notice of Mrs  Tattle  or her apprehensive looks  Mr  Eden explained all he knew of the affair in a few words   Your son  concluded he   will quickly put off his dirty dress  The dress hath not stained the mind  that is fair and honourable  When he found himself in the wrong  he said so  nor was he in haste to conceal his adventure from his father  this made me think well of both father and son  I speak plainly  friend  for that is best  But what is become of the other chimney  sweeper  He will want to go home  said Mr  Eden  turning to Mrs  Theresa  Without making any reply  she hurried out of the room as fast as possible  and returned in a few moments  with a look of extreme consternation   Here is a catastrophe indeed  Now  indeed  Mr  Frederick  your papa and mamma have reason to be angry  A new suit of clothes  the bare faced villain  gone  no sign of them in my closet  or anywhere  The door was locked  he must have gone up the chimney  out upon the leads  and so escaped  but Christopher is after him  I protest  Mrs  Montague  you take it too quietly  The wretch  a new suit of clothes  blue coat and buff waistcoat  I never heard of such a thing  I declare  Mr  Montague  you are vastly good  not to be in a passion  added Mrs  Theresa   Madam  replied Mr  Montague  with a look of much civil contempt   I think the loss of a suit of clothes  and even the disgrace that my son has been brought to this evening  fortunate circumstances in his education  He will  I am persuaded  judge and act for himself more wisely in future  Nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity  for the sake of being called  The best mimic in the world  THE BARRING OUT  OR  PARTY SPIRIT   The mother of mischief  says an old proverb   is no bigger than a midge  s wing  At Doctor Middleton  s school  there was a great tall dunce of the name of Fisher  who never could be taught how to look out a word in the dictionary  He used to torment everybody with  Do pray help me  I can  t make out this one word  The person who usually helped him in his distress was a very clever  good natured boy  of the name of De Grey  who had been many years under Dr  Middleton  s care  and who  by his abilities and good conduct  did him great credit  The doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him  but he was so well beloved  or so much esteemed by his companions  that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favourite  until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of Archer  Till Archer came  the ideas of FAVOURITES and PARTIES were almost unknown at Dr  Middleton  s  but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great public school  at which he had been educated  at which he had acquired a sufficient quantity of Greek and Latin  and a superabundant quantity of party spirit  His aim  the moment he came to a new school  was to get to the head of it  or at least to form the strongest party  His influence  for he was a boy of considerable abilities  was quickly felt  though he had a powerful rival  as he thought proper to call him  in De Grey  and  with HIM  a rival was always an enemy  De Grey  so far from giving him any cause of hatred  treated him with a degree of cordiality  which would probably have had an effect upon Archer  s mind  if it had not been for the artifices of Fisher  It may seem surprising  that a GREAT DUNCE should be able to work upon a boy like an Archer  who was called a great genius  but when genius is joined to a violent temper  instead of being united to good sense  it is at the mercy even of dunces  Fisher was mortally offended one morning by De Grey  s refusing to translate his whole lesson for him  He went over to Archer  who  considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy  received him with open arms  and translated his whole lesson without expressing MUCH contempt for his stupidity  From this moment Fisher forgot all De Grey  s former kindness  and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the person whom he felt to be so much his superior  De Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium  which was to be given in their class  Fisher betted on Archer  s head  who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a blockhead  On the contrary he suffered him to excite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets of all the school  So that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence  and Archer  instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favour  was listening to the opinions of all his companions  It was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions  but he suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance  The consequence was  that he trusted to chance  his partisans lost their wagers  and he the premium  and his temper   Mr  Archer  said Dr  Middleton  after the grand affair was decided   you have done all that genius alone could do  but you  De Grey  have done all that genius and industry united could do   Well  cried Archer  with affected gaiety  as soon as the doctor had left the room  Well  I  m content with MY sentence  Genius alone  for me  industry for those who WANT it  added he  with a significant look at De Grey  Fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech  and  by insinuations that Dr  Middleton  always gave the premium to De Grey  and that  those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it  for being such simpletons as to bet against the favourite  he raised a murmur highly flattering to Archer  amongst some of the most credulous boys  whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr  Middleton  s impartiality  These warmly congratulated De Grey  At this Archer grew more and more angry  and when Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense FOR him  pushed forward into the circle to De Grey  crying   I wish  Mr  Fisher  you would let me fight my own battles   And _I_ wish  said young Townsend  who was fonder of diversions than of premiums  or battles  or of anything else  _I_ wish  that we were not to have any battles  after having worked like horses  don  t set about to fight like dogs  Come  said he  tapping De Grey  s shoulder   let us see your new playhouse  do  it  s a holiday  and let us make the most of it  Let us have the  School for Scandal  do  and I  ll play Charles for you  and you  De Grey  shall be MY LITTLE PREMIUM  Come  do open this new playhouse of yours to  night   Come then  said De Grey  and he ran across the playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it  in which  at the earnest request of the whole community  and with the permission of Dr  Middleton  he had with much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre   The new theatre is going to be opened  Follow the manager  Follow the manager  echoed a multitude of voices   FOLLOW THE MANAGER  echoed very disagreeably in Archer  s ear  but as he could not be LEFT ALONE  he was also obliged to follow the manager  The moment that the door was unlocked  the crowd rushed in  the delight and wonder expressed at the sight was great  and the applause and thanks which were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud  Archer at least thought them long  for he was impatient till his voice could be heard  When at length the acclamations had spent themselves  he walked across the stage with a knowing air  and looking round contemptuously   And is THIS your famous playhouse  cried he   I wish you had  any of you  seen the playhouse _I_ have been used to  These words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions of the public   Who would be a servant of the public  or who would toil for popular applause  A few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new voice operated as a charm  and the playhouse was in an instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators  All gratitude for the past was forgotten  and the expectation of something better justified to the capricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced to be excellent  Everyone now began to criticise  One observed   that the green curtain was full of holes  and would not draw up  Another attacked the scenes   Scenes  they were not like real scenes  Archer must know best  because he was used to these things  So everybody crowded to hear something of the OTHER playhouse  They gathered round Archer to hear the description of his playhouse  and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made  When he had done  his auditors looked round  sighed and wished that Archer had been their manager  They turned from De Grey as from a person who had done them an injury  Some of his friends  for he had friends who were not swayed by the popular opinion  felt indignation at this ingratitude  and were going to express their feelings  but De Grey stopped them  and begged that he might speak for himself   Gentlemen  said he  coming forward  as soon as he felt that he had sufficient command of himself   My friends  I see you are discontented with me and my playhouse  I have done my best to please you  but if anybody else can please you better  I shall be glad of it  I did not work so hard for the glory of being your manager  You have my free leave to tear down  Here his voice faltered  but he hurried on  You have my free leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please  Archer  shake hands first  however  to show that there  s no malice in the case  Archer  who was touched by what his rival said  and  stopping the hand of his new partisan  Fisher  cried   No  Fisher  no  no pulling down  We can alter it  There is a great deal of ingenuity in it  considering  In vain Archer would now have recalled the public to reason  the time for reason was passed  enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds   Down with it  Down with it  Archer for ever  cried Fisher  and tore down the curtain  The riot once begun  nothing could stop the little mob  till the whole theatre was demolished  The love of power prevailed in the mind of Archer  he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his PARTY  and he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself  De Grey looked on superior   I said I could bear to see all this  and I can  said he   now it is all over  And now it was all over  there was silence  The rioters stood still to take breath  and to look at what they had done  There was a blank space before them  In this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice   Hush  What strange voice is that  said Archer  Fisher caught fast hold of his arm  Everybody looked round to see where the voice came from  It was dusk  Two window  shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards  De Grey  and in the same instant Archer  went forward  and  as the shutters opened  there appeared through the hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy  She did not speak  but she looked first at one and then at another  At length she fixed her eyes on De Grey   Well  woman  said he   what do you want with me   Want  nothing  with YOU  said the old woman   do you want nothing with ME   Nothing  said De Grey  Her eye immediately turned upon Archer  YOU want something with me  said she  with emphasis   I  what do I want  replied Archer   No  said she  changing her tone   you want nothing  nothing will you ever want  or I am much mistaken in that FACE  In that WATCH  CHAIN  she should have said  for her quick eye had espied Archer  s watch  chain  He was the only person in the company who had a watch  and she therefore judged him to be the richest   Had you ever your fortune told  sir  in your life   Not I  said he  looking at De Grey  as if he was afraid of his ridicule  if he listened to the gipsy   Not you  No  for you will make your own fortune  and the fortune of all that belong to you   There  s good news for my friends  cried Archer   And I  m one of them  remember that  cried Fisher   And I   And I  joined a number of voices   Good luck to them  cried the gipsy   good luck to them all  Then  as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good will  they pressed up to the window   There  cried Townsend  as he chanced to stumble over the carpenter  s mitre box  which stood in the way   there  s a good omen for me  I  ve stumbled on the mitre box  I shall certainly be a bishop  Happy he who had sixpence  for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench  And happier he who had a shilling  for he was in the high road to be one day upon the woolsack  Lord High Chancellor of England  No one had half a crown  or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion  for he might have been an archbishop  a king  or what he pleased  Fisher  who like all weak people was extremely credulous  kept his post immovable in the front row all the time  his mouth open  and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gipsy  in whom he felt implicit faith  Those who have least confidence in their own powers  and who have least expectation from the success of their own exertions  are always most disposed to trust in fortune  tellers and fortune  They hope to WIN  when they cannot EARN  and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense  it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense   I have a question to put  said Fisher  in a solemn tone   Put it  then  said Archer   what hinders you   But they will hear me  said he  looking suspiciously at De Grey   _I_ shall not hear you  said De Grey   I am going  Everybody else drew back  and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy  s ear   What is become of my Livy   Your SISTER Livy  do you mean  said the gipsy   No  my LATIN Livy  The gipsy paused for information   It had a leaf torn out in the beginning  and I HATE DR  MIDDLETON   Written in it  interrupted the gipsy   Right  the very book  cried Fisher with joy   But how COULD you know it was Dr  Middleton  s name  I thought I had scratched it  so that nobody could make it out   Nobody COULD make it out but ME  replied the gipsy   But never think to deceive me  said she  shaking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble   I don  t deceive you indeed  I tell you the whole truth  I lost it a week ago   True   And when shall I find it   Meet me here at this hour to  morrow evening  and I will answer you  No more  I must be gone  Not a word more to  night  She pulled the shutters towards her  and left the youth in darkness  All his companions were gone  He had been so deeply engaged in this conference  that he had not perceived their departure  He found all the world at supper  but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret  Townsend rallied in vain  As for Archer  he was not disposed to destroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old woman  s predictions in his favour had had upon the imagination of many of his little partisans  He had privately slipped two good shillings into the gipsy  s hand to secure her  for he was willing to pay any price for ANY means of acquiring power  The watch  chain had not deceived the gipsy  for Archer was the richest person in the community  His friends had imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted to boys of his age  Dr  Middleton had refused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his companions  but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five guineas  This appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible treasure  Riches and talents would  he flattered himself  secure to him that ascendancy of which he was so ambitious   Am I your manager  or not  was now his question   I scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment  but since last night you have had time to consider  If you desire me to be your manager  you shall see what a theatre I will make for you  In this purse  said he  showing through the network a glimpse of the shining treasure  in this purse is Aladdin  s wonderful lamp  Am I your manager  Put it to the vote  It was put to the vote  About ten of the most reasonable of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend  De Grey  but the numbers were in favour of the new friend  And as no metaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts  the most numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the right  They drew off on one side in triumph  and their leader  who knew the consequence of a name in party matters  immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of ARCHERS  stigmatizing the friends of De Grey by the odious epithet of Greybeards  Amongst the Archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications  but who  by their bodily activity  and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life  rendered themselves of the highest consequence  especially to the rich and enterprising  The judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the persons called day scholars  Amongst these  Fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town  and  though a dull scholar  he had such reputation as a man of business  that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioner  s  was sure to apply to him  Some of the youngest of his employers had  it is true  at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts  but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial  Fisher  s character and consequence were undiminished  till the fatal day when his Aunt Barbara forbade his visits to the confectioner  s  or  rather  till she requested the confectioner  who had his private reasons for obeying her  not TO RECEIVE her nephew  s visits  as he had made himself sick at his house  and Mrs  Barbara  s fears for his health were incessant  Though his visits to the confectioner  s were thus at an end  there were many other shops open to him  and with officious zeal he offered his services to the new manager  to purchase whatever might be wanting for the theatre  Since his father  s death Fisher had become a boarder at Dr  Middleton  s  but his frequent visits to his Aunt Barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town  The carpenter  De Grey  s friend  was discarded by Archer  for having said  LACK  A  DAISY  when he saw that the old theatre was pulled down  A new carpenter and paper hanger  recommended by Fisher  were appointed to attend  with their tools  for orders  at two o  clock  Archer  impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity  gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes  in a most decided manner   These things  he observed   should be done with some spirit  To which the carpenter readily assented  and added  that  gentlemen of spirit never looked to the EXPENSE  but always to the EFFECT  Upon this principle Mr  Chip set to work with all possible alacrity  In a few hours  time he promised to produce a grand effect  High expectations were formed  Nothing was talked of but the new playhouse  and so intent upon it was every head  that no lessons could be got  Archer was obliged  in the midst of his various occupations  to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people   O ye Athenians  he exclaimed   how hard do I work to obtain your praise  Impatient to return to the theatre  the moment the hours destined for instruction  or  as they are termed by schoolboys  school  hours  were over  each prisoner started up with a shout of joy   Stop one moment  gentlemen  if you please  said Dr  Middleton  in an awful voice   Mr  Archer  return to your place  Are you all here  The names of all the boys were called over  and when each had answered to his name  Dr  Middleton said   Gentlemen  I am sorry to interrupt your amusements  but  till you have contrary orders from me  no one  on pain of my serious displeasure  must go into THAT building  ( pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting )  Mr  Archer  your carpenter is at the door  You will be so good as to dismiss him  I do not think proper to give my reasons for these orders  but you who KNOW me  said the doctor  and his eye turned towards De Grey   will not suspect me of caprice  I depend  gentlemen  upon your obedience  To the dead silence with which these orders were received  succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan   So  said Townsend   all our diversion is over   So  whispered Fisher in the manager  s ear   this is some trick of the Greybeard  s  Did you not observe how he looked at De Grey  Fired by this thought  which had never entered his mind before  Archer started from his reverie  and striking his hand upon the table  swore that he  would not be outwitted by any Greybeard in Europe  no  nor by all of them put together  The Archers were surely a match for them  He would stand by them  if they would stand by him  he declared  with a loud voice   against the whole world  and Dr  Middleton himself  with  LITTLE PREMIUMS  at his right hand  Everybody admired Archer  s spirit  but were a little appalled at the sound of standing against Dr  Middleton   Why not  resumed the indignant manager   Neither Dr  Middleton nor any doctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice  This  you see  is a stroke at me and my party  and I won  t bear it   Oh  you are mistaken  said De Grey  who was the only one who dared to oppose reason to the angry orator   It cannot be a stroke aimed at  you and your party  for he does not know that you HAVE a party   I  ll make him know it  and I  ll make YOU know it  too  said Archer   Before I came here you reigned alone  now your reign is over  Mr  De Grey  Remember my majority this morning  and your theatre last night   He has remembered it  said Fisher   You see  the moment he was not to be our manager  we were to have no theatre  no playhouse  no plays  We must all sit down with our hands before us  all for  GOOD REASONS  of Dr  Middleton  s  which he does not vouchsafe to tell us   I won  t be governed by any man  s reasons that he won  t tell me  cried Archer   He cannot have good reasons  or why not tell them   Nonsense  said De Grey   WE SHALL NOT SUSPECT HIM OF CAPRICE   Why not   Because we who know him  have never known him capricious   Perhaps not  _I_ know nothing about him  said Archer   No  said De Grey   for that very reason _I_ speak who do know him  Don  t be in a passion  Archer   I will be in a passion  I won  t submit to tyranny  I won  t be made a fool of by a few soft words  You don  t know me  De Grey  I  ll go through with what I  ve begun  I am manager  and I will be manager  and you shall see my theatre finished in spite of you  and MY party triumphant   Party  repeated De Grey   I cannot imagine what is in the word  party  that seems to drive you mad  We never heard of parties till you came amongst us   No  before I came  I say  nobody dared oppose you  but I dare  and I tell you to your face  take care of me  a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto   I am not your enemy  I believe you are out of your senses  Archer  said he  laughing   Out of my senses  No  you are my enemy  Are you not my rival  Did not you win the premium  Did not you want to be manager  Answer me  are not you  in one word  a Greybeard   You called me a Greybeard  but my name is De Grey  said he  still laughing   Laugh on  cried the other  furiously   Come  ARCHERS  follow me  WE shall laugh by  and  by  I promise you  At the door Archer was stopped by Mr  Chip   Oh  Mr  Chip  I am ordered to discharge you   Yes  sir  and here  s a little bill   Bill  Mr  Chip  why  you have not been at work for two hours   Not much over  sir  but if you  ll please to look into it  you  ll see  tis for a few things you ordered  The stuff is all laid out and delivered  The paper and the festoon  bordering for the drawing room scene is cut out  and left yAnder within   YAnder  within  I wish you had not been in such a confounded hurry  six  and  twenty shillings  cried he   but I can  t stay to talk about it now  I  ll tell you  Mr  Chip  said Archer  lowering his voice   what you must do for me  my good fellow  Then  drawing Mr  Chip aside  he begged him to pull down some of the wood work which had been put up  and to cut it into a certain number of wooden bars  of which he gave him the dimensions  with orders to place them all  when ready  under a haystack  which he pointed out  Mr  Chip scrupled and hesitated  and began to talk of  THE DOCTOR  Archer immediately began to talk of the bill  and throwing down a guinea and a half  the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly  and made his bow   Well  Master Archer  said he   there  s no refusing you nothing  You have such a way of talking one out of it  You manage me just like a child   Ay  ay  said Archer  knowing that he had been cheated  and yet proud of managing a carpenter   ay  ay  I know the way to manage everybody  Let the things be ready in an hour  s time  and hark  e  leave your tools by mistake behind you  and a thousand of twenty  penny nails  Ask no questions  and keep your own counsel like a wise man  Off with you  and take care of  THE DOCTOR   Archers  Archers  to the Archers  tree  Follow your leader  cried he  sounding his well known whistle as a signal  His followers gathered round him  and he  raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree  counted his numbers  and then  in a voice lower than usual  addressed them thus  My friends  is there a Greybeard amongst us  If there is  let him walk off at once  he has my free leave  No one stirred   Then we are all Archers  and we will stand by one another  Join hands  my friends  They all joined hands   Promise me not to betray me  and I will go on  I ask no security but your honour  They all gave their honour to be secret and FAITHFUL  as he called it  and he went on   Did you ever hear of such a thing as a  BARRING OUT  my friends  They had heard of such a thing  but they had only heard of it  Archer gave the history of a  Barring Out  in which he had been concerned at his school  in which the boys stood out against the master  and gained their point at last  which was a week  s more holidays at Easter   But if WE should not succeed  said they   Dr  Middleton is so steady  he never goes back from what he has said   Did you ever try to push him back  Let us be steady and he  ll tremble  Tyrants always tremble when   Oh  interrupted a number of voices   but he is not a tyrant  is he   All schoolmasters are tyrants  are not they  replied Archer   and is not he a schoolmaster  To this logic there was no answer  but  still reluctant  they asked   What they should GET by a Barring Out   Get  everything  what we want  which is everything to lads of spirit   victory and liberty  Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law  till he lets us into our own theatre again  or till he tells us his  GOOD REASONS  against it   But perhaps he has reasons for not telling us   Impossible  cried Archer   that  s the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig  who says he has good reasons  and can  t tell them  Are you fools  Go  go back to De Grey  I see you are all Greybeards  Go  Who goes first  Nobody would go FIRST   I will have nothing to do with ye  if ye are resolved to be slaves   We won  t be slaves  they all exclaimed at once   Then  said Archer   stand out in the right and be free  [ This custom of  BARRING OUT  was very general ( especially in the northern parts of England ) during the th and th centuries  and it has been fully described by Brand and other antiquarian writers  Dr  Johnson mentions that Addison  while under the tuition of Mr  Shaw  master of the Lichfield Grammar School  led  and successfully conducted   a plan for BARRING OUT his master  A disorderly privilege  says the doctor   which  in his time  prevailed in the principal seminaries of education  In the Gentleman  s Magazine of   Dr  P  A  Nuttall  under the signature of II  A  N  has given a spirited sketch of a  BARRING OUT  at the Ormskirk Grammar School  which has since been republished at length ( though without acknowledgment ) by Sir Henry Ellis  in Bohn  s recent edition of Brand  s  Popular Antiquities  This operation took place early in the present century  and is interesting from its being  perhaps  the last attempt on record  and also from the circumstance of the writer himself having been one of the juvenile leaders in the daring adventure   quo rum pars magna fuit  Ed ]  THE RIGHT  It would have taken up too much time to examine what  THE RIGHT  was  Archer was always sure that  THE RIGHT  was what his party chose to do  that is  what he chose to do himself  and such is the influence of numbers upon each other  in conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of reasoning  that in a few minutes  the right  was forgotten  and each said to himself   To be sure  Archer is a very clever boy  and he can  t be mistaken  or   to be sure  Townsend thinks so  and he would not do anything to get us into a scrape  or   to be sure  everybody will agree to this but myself  and I can  t stand out alone  to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a slave  Everybody thinks it is right  and everybody can  t be wrong  By some of these arguments  which passed rapidly through the mind without his being conscious of them  each boy decided  and deceived himself  what none would have done alone  none scrupled to do as a party  It was determined  then  that there should be a Barring Out  The arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager  to whom they all pledged implicit obedience  Obedience  it seems  is necessary  even from rebels to their ringleaders  not reasonable  but implicit obedience  Scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball  alley  when Fisher  with an important length of face  came up to the manager  and desired to speak one word to him   My advice to you  Archer  is  to do nothing in this till we have consulted  YOU KNOW WHO  about whether it  s right or wrong   YOU KNOW WHO  Whom do you mean  Make haste  and don  t make so many faces  for I  m in a hurry  Who is  YOU KNOW WHO   The old woman  said Fisher  gravely   the gipsy   You may consult the old woman  said Archer  bursting out a  laughing   about what  s right and wrong  if you please  but no old woman shall decide for me   No  but you don  t TAKE me  said Fisher   you don  t TAKE me  By right and wrong  I mean lucky and unlucky   Whatever _I_ do will be lucky  replied Archer   My gipsy told you that already   I know  I know  said Fisher   and what she said about your friends being lucky  that went a great way with many  added he  with a sagacious nod of his head   I can tell you THAT  more than you think  Do you know  said he  laying hold of Archer  s button   I  m in the secret  There are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it  not to stir a step till we get her advice  and she has appointed me to meet her about particular business of my own at eight  So I  m to consult her and to bring her answer  Archer knew too well how to govern fools  to attempt to reason with them  and  instead of laughing any longer at Fisher  s ridiculous superstition  he was determined to take advantage of it  He affected to be persuaded of the wisdom of the measure  looked at his watch  urged him to be exact to a moment  conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle  and  above all things  to demand the lucky hour and minute when the Barring Out should begin  With these instructions Archer put his watch into the solemn dupe  s hand  and left him to count the seconds  till the moment of his appointment  whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle  At a little gate which looked into a lane  through which he guessed that the gipsy must pass  he stationed himself  saw her  gave her half a crown and her instructions  made his escape  and got back unsuspected to Fisher  whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him  watching the motion of the minute hand  Proud of his secret commission  Fisher slouched his hat  he knew not why  over his face  and proceeded towards the appointed spot  To keep  as he had been charged by Archer  within the letter of the law  he stood BEHIND the forbidden building  and waited some minutes  Through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance  muffled up  and looking cautiously about her   There  s nobody near us  said Fisher  and he began to be a little afraid   What answer  said he  recollecting himself   about my Livy   Lost  lost  lost  said the gipsy  lifting up her hands   never  never  never to be found  But no matter for that now  that is not your errand to  night  no tricks with me  speak to me of what is next your heart  Fisher  astonished  put his hand upon his heart  told her all that she knew before  and received the answers that Archer had dictated   That the Archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager  and to one another  that the Barring Out should end in woe  if not begun precisely as the clock should strike nine on Wednesday night  but if begun in that LUCKY moment  and all obedient to their LUCKY leader  all should end well  A thought  a provident thought  now struck Fisher  for even he had some foresight where his favourite passion was concerned   Pray  in our Barring Out shall we be starved   No  said the gipsy   not if you trust to me for food  and if you give me money enough  Silver won  t do for so many  gold is what must cross my hand   I have no gold  said Fisher   and I don  t know what you mean by  so many  I  m only talking of number one  you know  I must take care of that first  So  as Fisher thought it was possible that Archer  clever as he was  might be disappointed in his supplies  he determined to take secret measures for himself  His Aunt Barbara  s interdiction had shut him out of the confectioner  s shop  but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt  he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by Thursday morning  and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the schoolroom  As Fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal  it was at first absolutely rejected  but a bribe at length conquered his difficulties  and the bribe which Fisher found himself obliged to give  for he had no pocket money left of his own  he being as much RESTRICTED in that article as Archer was INDULGED  the bribe that he found himself obliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a crown  which Archer had intrusted to him to buy candles for the theatre   Oh  thought he to himself   Archer  s so careless about money  he will never think of asking me for the half  crown again  and now he  ll want no candles for the THEATRE  or  at anyrate  it will be some time first  and maybe  Aunt Barbara may be got to give me that much at Christmas  then  if the worst comes to the worst  one can pay Archer  My mouth waters for the buns  and have  em I must now  So  for the hope of twelve buns  he sacrificed the money which had been intrusted to him  Thus the meanest motives  in mean minds often prompt to the commission of those great faults  to which one should think nothing but some violent passion could have tempted  The ambassador having thus  in his opinion  concluded his own and the public business  returned well satisfied with the result  after receiving the gipsy  s reiterated promise to tap THREE TIMES at the window on Thursday morning  The day appointed for the Barring Out at length arrived  and Archer  assembling the confederates  informed them  that all was prepared for carrying their design into execution  that he now depended for success upon their punctuality and courage  He had  within the last two hours  got all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom  he had  with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the party  sent into the town for provisions  at his own expense  which would make a handsome supper for that night  he had also negotiated with some cousins of his  who lived in the town  for a constant supply in future   Bless me  exclaimed Archer  suddenly stopping in this narration of his services   there  s one thing  after all  I  ve forgot  we shall be undone without it  Fisher  pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse   No  to be sure  replied Fisher  extremely frightened   you know you don  t want candles for the playhouse now   Not for the playhouse  but for the Barring Out  We shall be in the dark  man  You must run this minute  run   For candles  said Fisher  confused   how many  what sort   Stupidity  exclaimed Archer   you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift  Lend me a pencil and a bit of paper  do  I  ll write down what I want myself  Well  what are you fumbling for   For money  said Fisher  colouring   Money  man  Didn  t I give you half a crown the other day   Yes  replied Fisher  stammering   but I wasn  t sure that that might be enough   Enough  yes  to be sure it will  I don  t know what you are AT   Nothing  nothing  said Fisher   here  write upon this  then  said Fisher  putting a piece of paper into Archer  s hand  upon which Archer wrote his orders   Away  away  cried he  Away went Fisher  He returned  but not until a considerable time afterwards  They were at supper when he returned   Fisher always comes in at supper  time  observed one of the Greybeards  carelessly   Well  and would you have him come in AFTER supper  time  said Townsend  who always supplied his party with ready wit   I  ve got the candles  whispered Fisher as he passed by Archer to his place   And the tinder  box  said Archer   Yes  I got back from my Aunt Barbara under pretence that I must study for repetition day an hour later to  night  So I got leave  Was not that clever  A dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by SOBER LIES  How Mr  Fisher procured the candles and the tinder box without money  and without credit  we shall discover further on  Archer and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom  and as soon as the Greybeards were gone out to bed  he  as the signal  was to shut and lock one door  Townsend the other  A third conspirator was to strike a light  in case they should not be able to secure a candle  A fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted  and all the rest were to run to their bars  which were secreted in a room  then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window  in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager  Thus each had his part assigned  and each was warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality  Order and punctuality  it appears  are necessary even in a Barring Out  and even rebellion must have its laws  The long expected moment at length arrived  De Grey and his friends  unconscious of what was going forward  walked out of the schoolroom as usual at bedtime  The clock began to strike nine  There was one Greybeard left in the room  who was packing up some of his books  which had been left about by accident  It is impossible to describe the impatience with which he was watched  especially by Fisher  and the nine who depended upon the gipsy oracle  When he had got all his books together under his arm  he let one of them fall  and whilst he stooped to pick it up  Archer gave the signal  The doors were shut  locked  and double  locked in an instant  A light was struck and each ran to his post  The bars were all in the same moment put up to the windows  and Archer  when he had tried them all  and seen that they were secure  gave a loud  Huzza  in which he was joined by all the party most manfully  by all but the poor Greybeard  who  the picture of astonishment  stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm  at which spectacle Townsend  who enjoyed the FROLIC of the fray more than anything else  burst into an immoderate fit of laughter   So  my little Greybeard  said he  holding a candle full in his eyes   what think you of all this  How came you amongst the wicked ones   I don  t know  indeed  said the little boy  very gravely   you shut me up amongst you  Won  t you let me out   Let you out  No  no  my little Greybeard  said Archer  catching hold of him  and dragging him to the window bars   Look ye here  touch these   put your hand to them  pull  push  kick  put a little spirit into it  man  kick like an Archer  if you can  away with ye  It  s a pity that the king of the Greybeards is not here to admire me  I should like to show him our fortifications  But come  my merry men all  now to the feast  Out with the table into the middle of the room  Good cheer  my jolly Archers  I  m your manager  Townsend  delighted with the bustle  rubbed his hands  and capered about the room  whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward   Four candles  Four candles on the table  Let  s have things in style when we are about it  Mr  Manager  cried Townsend   Places  Places  There  s nothing like a fair scramble  my boys  Let everyone take care of himself  Hallo  Greybeard  I  ve knocked Greybeard down here in the scuffle  Get up again  my lad  and see a little life   No  no  cried Fisher   he sha  n  t SUP with us   No  no  cried the manager   he shan  t LIVE with us  a Greybeard is not fit company for Archers   No  no  cried Townsend   evil communication corrupts good manners  So with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a corner  and having pent him up with benches  Fisher opened his books for him  which he thought the greatest mortification  and set up a candle beside him  There  now he looks like a Greybeard as he is  cried they   Tell me what  s the Latin for cold roast beef  said Fisher  exultingly  and they returned to their feast  Long and loud they revelled  They had a few bottles of cider   Give me the corkscrew  the cider sha  n  t be kept till it  s sour  cried Townsend  in answer to the manager  who  when he beheld the provisions vanishing with surprising rapidity  began to fear for the morrow   Hang to  morrow  cried Townsend   let Greybeards think of to  morrow  Mr  Manager  here  s your good health  The Archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink the health of their chief with a universal cheer  But at the moment that the cups were at their lips  and as Archer bowed to thank the company  a sudden shower from above astonished the whole assembly  They looked up  and beheld the rose of a watering  engine  whose long neck appeared through a trap door in the ceiling   Your good health  Mr  Manager  said a voice  which was known to be the gardener  s  and in the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly extinguished  the trap  door shut down  and they were left in utter darkness   The DEVIL  said Archer   Don  t swear  Mr  Manager  said the same voice from the ceiling   I hear every word you say   Mercy upon us  exclaimed Fisher   The clock  added he  whispering   must have been wrong  for it had not done striking when we began  Only  you remember  Archer  it had just done before you had done locking your door   Hold your tongue  blockhead  said Archer   Well  boys  were ye never in the dark before  You are not afraid of a shower of rain  I hope  Is anybody drowned   No  said they  with a faint laugh   but what shall we do here in the dark all night long  and all day to  morrow  We can  t unbar the shutters   It  s a wonder NOBODY ever thought of the trap  door  said Townsend  The trap  door had indeed escaped the manager  s observation  As the house was new to him  and the ceiling being newly white  washed  the opening was scarcely perceptible  Vexed to be out  generalled  and still more vexed to have it remarked  Archer poured forth a volley of incoherent exclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon discouraged by a trifle  and groping for the tinder  box  he asked if anything could be easier than to strike a light again  The light appeared  But at the moment that it made the tinder  box visible  another shower from above  aimed  and aimed exactly  at the tinder  box  drenched it with water  and rendered it totally unfit for further service  Archer in a fury dashed it to the ground  And now for the first time he felt what it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party  He heard in his turn the murmurs of a discontented  changeable populace  and recollecting all his bars and bolts  and ingenious contrivances  he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the disaster itself   Lucifer matches were then unknown  Ed   Oh  my hair is all wet  cried one  dolefully   Wring it  then  said Archer   My hand  s cut with your broken glass  cried another   Glass  cried a third   mercy  is there broken glass  and it  s all about  I suppose  amongst the supper  and I had but one bit of bread all the time   Bread  cried Archer   eat if you want it  Here  s a piece here  and no glass near it   It  s all wet  and I don  t like dry bread by itself  that  s no feast   Heigh  day  What  nothing but moaning and grumbling  If these are the joys of a Barring Out  cried Townsend   I  d rather be snug in my bed  I expected that we should have sat up till twelve o  clock  talking  and laughing  and singing   So you may still  what hinders you  said Archer   Sing  and we  ll join you  and I should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing  Begin  Townsend   Come now  all ye social Powers  Spread your influence o  er us  Or else   Rule  Britannia  Britannia rules the waves  Britons never will be slaves  Nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment  In vain they roared in chorus  In vain they tried to appear gay  It would not do  The voices died away  and dropped off one by one  They had each provided himself with a great  coat to sleep upon  but now  in the dark  there was a peevish scrambling contest for the coats  and half the company  in very bad humour  stretched themselves upon the benches for the night  There is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it  but when people feel themselves foiled  there is no further pleasure in endurance  and if  in their misfortune  there is any mixture of the ridiculous  the motives for heroism are immediately destroyed  Dr  Middleton had probably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack  Archer  who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government upon his shoulders  rose early in the morning  whilst everybody else was fast asleep  In the night he had resolved the affair of the trap  door  and a new danger had alarmed him  It was possible that the enemy might descend upon them through the trap  door  The room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air  It was twenty feet  so that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trap  door  As soon as the daylight appeared  Archer rose softly  that he might RECONNOITRE  and devise some method of guarding against this new danger  Luckily there were round holes in the top of the window  shutters  which admitted sufficient light for him to work by  The remains of the soaked feast  wet candles  and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of the room  looked rather dismal this morning   A pretty set of fellows I have to manage  said Archer  contemplating the group of sleepers before him   It is well they have somebody to think for them  Now if I wanted  which  thank goodness  I don  t  but if I did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance  whom could I pitch upon  not this stupid snorer  who is dreaming of gipsies  if he is dreaming of anything  continued Archer  as he looked into Fisher  s open mouth   This next chap is quick enough  but  then  he is so fond of having everything his own way  And this curl pated monkey  who is grinning in his sleep  is all tongue and no brains  Here are brains  though nobody would think it  in this lump  said he  looking at a fat  rolled up  heavy breathing sleeper   but what signify brains to such a lazy dog  I might kick him for my football this half hour before I should get him awake  This lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy fellow  to be sure  but  then  if he has hands  he has no head  and he  d be afraid of his own shadow too  by this light  he is such a coward  And Townsend  why  he has puns in plenty  but  when there  s any work to be done  he  s the worst fellow to be near one in the world  he can do nothing but laugh at his own puns  This poor little fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together  but then he is a Greybeard  Thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends  And how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set  when  for each individual of which it was composed  he felt such supreme contempt  He had formed them into a PARTY  had given them a name  and he was at their head  If these be not good reasons  none better can be assigned for Archer  s conduct   I wish ye could all sleep on  said he   but I must waken ye  though you will be only in my way  The sound of my hammering must waken them  so I may as well do the thing handsomely  and flatter some of them by pretending to ask their advice  Accordingly  he pulled two or three to waken them   Come  Townsend  waken  my boy  Here  s some diversion for you  up  up   Diversion  cried Townsend   I  m your man  I  m up  UP TO ANYTHING  So  under the name of DIVERSION  Archer set Townsend to work at four o  clock in the morning  They had nails  a few tools  and several spars  still left from the wreck of the playhouse  These  by Archer  s directions  they sharpened at one end  and nailed them to the ends of several forms  All hands were now called to clear away the supper things  to erect these forms perpendicularly under the trap  door  and with the assistance of a few braces  a chevaux  de  frise was formed  upon which nobody could venture to descend  At the farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the tables  under which they proposed to breakfast  secure from the pelting storm  if it should again assail them through the trap  door  They crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready  and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job   Lord  I shall like to see the gardener  s phiz through the trap  door  when he beholds the spikes under him  cried Townsend   Now for breakfast   Ay  now for breakfast  said Archer  looking at his watch   past eight o  clock  and my town boys not come  I don  t understand this  Archer had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who lived in the town  who were cousins of his  and who had promised to come every day  and put food in at a certain hole in the wall  in which a ventilator usually turned  This ventilator Archer had taken down  and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure  but  upon examination  it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back  which it was impossible to penetrate or remove   It never came into my head that anybody would ever have thought of the ventilator but myself  exclaimed Archer  in great perplexity  He listened and waited for his cousins  but no cousins came  and at a late hour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last night  s feast  That feast had been spread with such imprudent profusion  that little now remained to satisfy the hungry guests  Archer  who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity would have upon his associates  did everything that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only delayed  The delay  however  was alarming  Fisher alone heard the manager  s calculations and saw the public fears unmoved  Secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom  he walked from window to window  slily listening for the gipsy  s signal   There it is  cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before   Come this way  Archer  but don  t tell anybody  Hark  do ye hear those three taps at the window  This is the old woman with twelve buns for me  I  ll give you one whole one for yourself  if you will unbar the window for me   Unbar the window  interrupted Archer   no  that I won  t  for you or the gipsy either  but I have heard enough to get your buns without that  But stay  there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns  I must think for ye all  I see  regularly  So he summoned a council  and proposed that everyone should subscribe  and trust the subscription to the gipsy  to purchase a fresh supply of provisions  Archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription  at which sight all the company clapped their hands  and his popularity rose to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty  Now  having made a list of their wants  they folded the money in the paper  put it into a bag  which Archer tied to a long string  and  having broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window  shutter  he let down the bag to the gipsy  She promised to be punctual  and having filled the bag with Fisher  s twelve buns  they were drawn up in triumph  and everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinner  time  The buns were a little squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window  shutter  but Archer immediately sawed out a piece of the shutter  and broke the corresponding panes in each of the other windows  to prevent suspicion  and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air  What a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no purpose  It may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so punctual to her promise to Fisher  but we must recollect that her apparent integrity was only cunning  she was punctual that she might be employed again  that she might be intrusted with the contribution which  she foresaw  must be raised amongst the famishing garrison  No sooner had she received the money than her end was gained  Dinner  time came  it struck three  four  five  six  They listened with hungry ears  but no signal was heard  The morning had been very long  and Archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply  And now those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of their disappointment  Archer  in the division of the food  had attempted  by the most scrupulous exactness  to content the public  and he was both astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached  So differently do people judge in different situations  He was the first person to accuse his master of injustice  and the least capable of bearing such an imputation upon himself from others  He now experienced some of the joys of power  and the delight of managing unreasonable numbers   Have not I done everything I could to please you  Have not I spent my money to buy you food  Have not I divided the last morsel with you  I have not tasted one mouthful today  Did not I set to work for you at sunrise  Did not I lie awake all night for you  Have not I had all the labour  and all the anxiety  Look round and see MY contrivances  MY work  MY generosity  And  after all  you think me a tyrant  because I want you to have common sense  Is not this bun which I hold in my hand my own  Did not I earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce  ( pointing to Fisher )  who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns  if I had not shown him how  Eleven of them he has eaten since morning for his own share  without offering anyone a morsel  but I scorn to eat even what is justly my own  when I see so many hungry creatures longing for it  I was not going to touch this last morsel myself  I only begged you to keep it till supper  time  when perhaps you  ll want it more  and Townsend  who can  t bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims  and who thinks there  s nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion  calls me a TYRANT  You all of you promised to obey me  The first thing I ask you to do for your own good  and when  if you had common sense  you must know I can want nothing but your good  you rebel against me  Traitors  fools  ungrateful fools  Archer walked up and down  unable to command his emotion  whilst  for the moment  the discontented multitude was silenced   Here  said he  striking his hand upon the little boy  s shoulder   here  s the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint  and he has had but one bit of bread  a bit that I gave him myself this day  Here  said he  snatching the bun  which nobody had dared to touch   take it  it  s mine  I give it to you  though you are a Greybeard  you deserve it  Eat it  and be an Archer  You shall be my captain  will you  said he  lifting him up in his arm above the rest   I like you now  said the little boy  courageously   but I love De Grey better  he has always been my friend  and he advised me never to call myself any of those names  Archer or Greybeard  so I won  t  Though I am shut in here  I have nothing to do with it  I love Dr  Middleton  he was never unjust to ME  and I daresay that he has very good reasons  as De Grey said  for forbidding us to go into that house  Besides  it  s his own  Instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad  Archer suffered Townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands  He flung it at a hole in the window  but it fell back  The Archers scrambled for it  and Fisher ate it  Archer saw this  and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in suffering it  A few moments ago he had admired his own generosity  and though he had felt the injustice of others  he had not accused himself of any  He turned away from the little boy  and sitting down at one end of the table  hid his face in his hands  He continued immovable in this posture for some time   Lord  said Townsend   it was an excellent joke   Pooh  said Fisher   what a fool  to think so much about a bun   Never mind  Mr  Archer  if you are thinking about me  said the little boy  trying gently to pull his hands from his face  Archer stooped down  and lifted him up upon the table  at which sight the partisans set up a general hiss   He has forsaken us  He deserts his party  He wants to be a Greybeard  After he has got us all into this scrape  he will leave us   I am not going to leave you  cried Archer   No one shall ever accuse me of deserting my party  I  ll stick by the Archers  right or wrong  I tell you  to the last moment  But this little fellow  take it as you please  mutiny if you will  and throw me out of the window  Call me traitor  coward  Greybeard  this little fellow is worth you all put together  and I  ll stand by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger upon him  and the next morsel of food that I see shall be his  Touch him who dares  The commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked  and the belief that the little boy deserved his protection  silenced the crowd  But the storm was only hushed  No sound of merriment was now to be heard  no battledore and shuttlecock   no ball  no marbles  Some sat in a corner  whispering their wishes that Archer would unbar the doors  and give up  Others  stretching their arms  and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room  wished for air  or food  or water  Fisher and his nine  who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy  now gave themselves up to utter despair  It was eight o  clock  growing darker and darker every minute  and no candles  no light could they have  The prospect of another long dark night made them still more discontented  Townsend  at the head of the yawners  and Fisher  at the head of the hungry malcontents  gathered round Archer and the few yet unconquered spirits  demanding  How long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon  and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake  The idea of GIVING UP was more intolerable to Archer than all the rest  He saw that the majority  his own convincing argument  was against him  He was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion  He flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys  Some he reminded of their promises  others he praised for former prowess  and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business  It was at length resolved that at all events they WOULD HOLD OUT  With this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep  for the second night  in weak and weary obstinacy  Archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning  and when he awoke  he found his hands tied behind him  Three or four boys had just got hold of his feet  which they pressed down  whilst the trembling hands of Fisher were fastening the cord round them  With all the force which rage could inspire  Archer struggled and roared to  HIS ARCHERS  his friends  his party  for help against the traitors  But all kept aloof  Townsend  in particular  stood laughing and looking on   I beg your pardon  Archer  but really you look so droll  All alive and kicking  Don  t be angry  I  m so weak  I cannot help laughing today  The packthread cracked   His hands are free  He  s loose  cried the least of the boys  and ran away  whilst Archer leaped up  and seizing hold of Fisher with a powerful grasp  sternly demanded  What he meant by this   Ask my party  said Fisher  terrified   they set me on  ask my party   Your party  cried Archer  with a look of ineffable contempt   you reptile  YOUR party  Can such a thing as YOU have a party   To be sure  said Fisher  settling his collar  which Archer in his surprise had let go   to be sure  Why not  Any man who chooses it may have a party as well as yourself  I suppose  I have nine Fishermen  At these words  spoken with much sullen importance  Archer  in spite of his vexation  could not help laughing   Fishermen  cried he   FISHERMEN   And why not Fishermen as well as Archers  cried they   One party is just as good as another  it is only a question which can get the upper hand  and we had your hands tied just now   That  s right  Townsend  said Archer   laugh on  my boy  Friend or foe  it  s all the same to you  I know how to value your friendship now  You are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines  but let a storm come  and how you slink away  At this instant  Archer felt the difference between A GOOD COMPANION and a good friend  a difference which some people do not discover till late in life   Have I no friend  no real friend amongst you all  And could ye stand by  and see my hands tied behind me like a thief  s  What signifies such a party  all mute   We want something to eat  answered the Fishermen   What signifies SUCH a party  indeed  and SUCH a manager  who can do nothing for one   And have _I_ done nothing   Don  t let  s hear any more prosing  said Fisher   we are too many for you  I  ve advised my party  if they  ve a mind not to be starved  to give you up for the ringleader  as you were  and Dr  Middleton will not let us all off  I daresay  So  depending upon the sullen silence of the assembly  he again approached Archer with a cord  A cry of  No  no  no  Don  t tie him  was feebly raised  Archer stood still  but the moment Fisher touched him he knocked him down to the ground  and turning to the rest  with eyes sparkling with indignation   Archers  cried he  A voice at this instant was heard at the door  It was De Grey  s voice   I have got a large basket of provisions for your breakfast  A general shout of joy was sent forth by the voracious public   Breakfast  Provisions  A large basket  De Grey for ever  Huzza  De Grey promised  upon his honour  that if he would unbar the door nobody should come in with him  and no advantage should be taken of them  This promise was enough even for Archer   I will let him in  said he   myself  for I  m sure he  ll never break his word  He pulled away the bar  the door opened  and having bargained for the liberty of Melson  the little boy  who had been shut in by mistake  De Grey entered with his basket of provisions  when he locked and barred the door instantly  Joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket  and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast  A hundred questions were asked him at once   Eat first  said he   and we will talk afterwards  This business was quickly despatched by those who had not tasted food for a long while  Their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished   Who sent us breakfast  Does Dr  Middleton know  were questions reiterated from every mouth   He does know  answered De Grey   and the first thing I have to tell you is  that I am your fellow  prisoner  I am to stay here till you give up  This was the only condition on which Dr  Middleton would allow me to bring you food  and he will allow no more  Everyone looked at the empty basket  But Archer  in whom half vanquished party spirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast  broke into exclamations in praise of De Grey  s magnanimity  as he now imagined that De Grey had become one of themselves   And you will join us  will you  That  s a noble fellow   No  answered De Grey  calmly   but I hope to persuade  or rather to convince you  that you ought to join me   You would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us  whichever you pleased  said Townsend   if you had appealed to Archers fasting  but Archers feasting are quite other animals  Even Caesar himself  after breakfast  is quite another thing  added he  pointing to Archer   You may speak for yourself  Mr  Townsend  replied the insulted hero   but not for me  or for Archers in general  if you please  We unbarred the door upon the faith of De Grey  s promise  THAT was not giving up  And it would have been just as difficult  I promise you  to persuade or convince me either that I should give up against my honour before breakfast as after  This spirited speech was applauded by many  who had now forgotten the feelings of famine  Not so Fisher  whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct   What nonsense  and the orator paused for a synonymous expression  but none was at hand   What nonsense and  nonsense is here  Why  don  t you remember that dinner  time  and supper  time and breakfast  time will come again  So what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing  We will not go through again what we did yesterday  Honour me no honour  I don  t understand it  I  d rather be flogged at once  as I have been many  s the good time for a less thing  I say  we  d better all be flogged at once  which must be the end of it sooner or later  than wait here to be without dinner  breakfast  and supper  all only because Mr  Archer won  t give up because of his honour and nonsense  Many prudent faces amongst the Fishermen seemed to deliberate at the close of this oration  in which the arguments were brought so  home to each man  s business and bosom   But  said De Grey   when we yield  I hope it will not be merely to get our dinner  gentlemen  When we yield  Archer   Don  t address yourself to me  interrupted Archer  struggling with his pride   you have no further occasion to try to win me  I have no power  no party  you see  And now I find that I have no friends  I don  t care what becomes of myself  I suppose I  m to be given up as a ringleader  Here  s this Fisher  and a party of his Fishermen  were going to tie me hand and foot  if I had not knocked him down  just as you came to the door  De Grey  and now perhaps you will join Fisher  s party against me  De Grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party  when a sudden change appeared on Archer  s countenance   Silence  cried Archer  in an imperious tone  and there was silence  Someone was heard to whistle the beginning of a tune  that was perfectly new to everybody present  except to Archer  who immediately whistled the conclusion   There  cried he  looking at De Grey  with triumph   that  s a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner  which I learned from  Richard Coeur de Lion  I know how to make use of everything  Hallo  friend  are you there at last  cried he  going to the ventilator   Yes  but we are barred out here   Round to the window then  and fill our bag  We  ll let it down  my lad  in a trice  bar me out who can  Archer let down the bag with all the expedition of joy  and it was filled with all the expedition of fear   Pull away  make haste  for Heaven  s sake  said the voice from without   the gardener will come from dinner  else  and we shall be caught  He mounted guard all yesterday at the ventilator  and though I watched and watched till it was darker than pitch  I could not get near you  I don  t know what has taken him out of the way now  Make haste  pull away  The heavy bag was soon pulled up   Have you any more  said Archer   Yes  plenty  Let down quick  I  ve got the tailor  s bag full  which is three times as large as yours  and I  ve changed clothes with the tailor  s boy  so nobody took notice of me as I came down the street   There  s my own cousin  exclaimed Archer   there  s a noble fellow  there  s my own cousin  I acknowledge  Fill the bag  then  Several times the bag descended and ascended  and at every unlading of the crane  fresh acclamations were heard   I have no more  at length the boy with the tailor  s bag cried   Off with you  then  we  ve enough  and thank you  A delightful review was now made of their treasure  Busy hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass  Archer  in the height of his glory  looked on  the acknowledged master of the whole  Townsend  who  in his prosperity as in adversity  saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends  pushed De Grey  who was looking on with a more good  natured and more thoughtful air   Friend  said he   you look like a great philosopher  and Archer a great hero   And you  Townsend  said Archer   may look like a wit  if you will  but you will never be a hero   No  no  replied Townsend   wits were never heroes  because they are wits  You are out of your wits  and therefore may set up for a hero   Laugh  and welcome  I  m not a tyrant  I don  t want to restrain anybody  s wit  but I cannot say I admire puns   Nor I  either  said the time serving Fisher  sidling up to the manager  and picking the ice off a piece of plum  cake   nor I either  I hate puns  I can never understand Townsend  s PUNS  Besides  anybody can make puns  and one doesn  t want wit  either  at all times  for instance  when one is going to settle about dinner  or business of consequence  Bless us all  Archer  continued he  with sudden familiarity   WHAT A SIGHT OF GOOD THINGS ARE HERE  I  m sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin  I never thought he  d have come  Why  now we can hold out as long as you please  Let us see  said he  dividing the provisions upon the table   we can hold out to  day  and all to  morrow  and part of next day  maybe  Why  now we may defy the doctor and the Greybeards  The doctor will surely give up to us  for  you see  he knows nothing of all this  and he  ll think we are starving all this while  and he  d be afraid  you see  to let us starve quite  in reality  for three whole days  because of what would be said in the town  My Aunt Barbara  for one  would be AT HIM long before that time was out  and besides  you know  in that case  he  d be hanged for murder  which is quite another thing  in law  from a BARRING OUT  you know  Archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which it deserved  for his eye was fixed upon De Grey   What is De Grey thinking of  he asked  impatiently   I am thinking  said De Grey   that Dr  Middleton must believe that I have betrayed his confidence in me  The gardener was ordered away from his watch  post for one half  hour when I was admitted  This half  hour the gardener has made nearly a hour  I never would have come near you if I had foreseen all this  Dr  Middleton trusted me  and now he will repent of his confidence in me   De Grey  cried Archer  with energy   he shall not repent of his confidence in you  nor shall you repent of coming amongst us  You shall find that we have some honour as well as yourself  and I will take care of your honour as if it were my OWN   Hey  day  interrupted Townsend   are heroes allowed to change sides  pray  And does the chief of the Archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the Greybeards  In the middle of his own party too   Party  repeated Archer  disdainfully   I have done with parties  I see what parties are made of  I have felt the want of a friend  and I am determined to make one if I can   That you may do  said De Grey  stretching out his hand   Unbar the doors  unbar the windows  exclaimed Archer   Away with all these things  I give up for De Grey  s sake  He shall not lose his credit on my account   No  said De Grey   you shall not give up for my sake   Well  then  I  ll give up to do what is HONOURABLE  said Archer   Why not to do what is REASONABLE  said De Grey   REASONABLE  Oh  the first thing that a man of spirit should think of is  what is HONOURABLE   But how will he find out WHAT IS honourable  unless he can reason  replied De Grey   Oh  said Archer   his own feelings always tell him what is honourable   Have not YOUR FEELINGS  asked De Grey   changed within these few hours   Yes  with circumstances  replied Archer   but right or wrong  as long as I think it honourable to do so and so  I  m satisfied   But you cannot think anything honourable  or the contrary  observed De Grey   without reasoning  and as to what you call feeling  it  s only a quick sort of reasoning   The quicker  the better  said Archer   Perhaps not  said De Grey   We are apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a hurry   But  said Archer   we have not always time enough to reason AT FIRST   You must  however  acknowledge  replied De Grey  smiling   that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong AT LAST  Is it not  therefore  best to begin by reasoning to find out the right AT FIRST   To be sure  said Archer   And did you reason with yourself at first  And did you find out that it was right to bar Dr  Middleton out of his own schoolroom  because he desired you not to go into one of his own houses   No  replied Archer   but I should never have thought of heading a Barring Out  if he had not shown partiality  and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery  which would have been quite natural  and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge  there would have been none of this work   Why  said De Grey   should you suspect me of such a mean action  when you have never seen or known me do anything mean  and when in this instance you have no proofs   Will you give me your word and honour now  De Grey  before everybody here  that you did not do what I suspected   I do assure you  upon my honour  I never  indirectly  spoke to Dr  Middleton about the playhouse   Then  said Archer   I  m as glad as if I had found a thousand pounds  Now you are my friend indeed   And Dr  Middleton  why should you suspect him without reason any more than me   As to that  said Archer   he is your friend  and you are right to defend him  and I won  t say another word against him  Will that satisfy you   Not quite   Not quite  Then  indeed you are unreasonable   No  replied De Grey   for I don  t wish you to yield out of friendship to me  any more than to honour  If you yield to reason  you will be governed by reason another time   Well  but then don  t triumph over me  because you have the best side of the argument   Not I  How can I  said De Grey   for now you are on THE BEST SIDE as well as myself  are not you  So we may triumph together   You are a good friend  said Archer  and with great eagerness he pulled down the fortifications  whilst every hand assisted  The room was restored to order in a few minutes  the shutters were thrown open  the cheerful light let in  The windows were thrown up  and the first feeling of the fresh air was delightful  The green playgound opened before them  and the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of these voluntary prisoners  But  alas  they were not yet at liberty  The idea of Dr  Middleton  and the dread of his vengeance  smote their hearts  When the rebels had sent an ambassador with their surrender  they stood in pale and silent suspense  waiting for their doom   Ah  said Fisher  looking up at the broken panes in the windows   the doctor will think the most of THAT  he  ll never forgive us for that   Hush  here he comes  His steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer  Archer threw open the door  and Dr  Middleton entered  Fisher instantly fell on his knees   It is no delight to me to see people on their knees  Stand up  Mr  Fisher  I hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong   Sir  said Archer   they are conscious that they have done wrong  and so am I  I am the ringleader  Punish me as you think proper  I submit  Your punishments  your vengeance ought to fall on me alone   Sir  said Dr  Middleton  calmly   I perceive that whatever else you may have learned in the course of your education  you have not been taught the meaning of the word punishment  Punishment and vengeance do not with us mean the same thing  PUNISHMENT is pain given  with the reasonable hope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing  IN FUTURE  what will hurt themselves or others  VENGEANCE never looks to the FUTURE  but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past  I feel no anger  you have done me no injury  Here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows   Yes  I see that you have broken my windows  that is a small evil   Oh  sir  How good  How merciful  exclaimed those who had been most panic  struck   He forgives us   Stay  resumed Dr  Middleton   I cannot forgive you  I shall never revenge  but it is my duty to punish  You have rebelled against the just authority which is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have not sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves  Without obedience to the laws  added he  turning to Archer   as men  you cannot be suffered in society  You  sir  think yourself a man  I observe  and you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another  I have no pleasure in making others  whether men or children  submit to my WILL  but my reason and experience are superior to yours  Your parents at least think so  or they would not have intrusted me with the care of your education  As long as they do intrust you to my care  and as long as I have any hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment  I shall steadily inflict it  whenever I judge it to be necessary  and I judge it to be necessary NOW  This is a long sermon  Mr  Archer  not preached to show my own eloquence  but to convince your understanding  Now  as to your punishment   Name it  sir  said Archer   whatever it is  I will cheerfully submit to it   Name it yourself  said Dr  Middleton   and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment  Archer  proud to be treated like a reasonable creature  and sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy  was silent for some time  but at length replied   That he would rather not name his own punishment  He repeated  however  that he trusted he should bear it well  whatever it might be   I shall  then  said Dr  Middleton   deprive you  for two months  of pocket  money  as you have had too much  and have made a bad use of it   Sir  said Archer   I brought five guineas with me to school  This guinea is all that I have left  Dr  Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him with a look of approbation  and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom  The rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctor  s sentence against them  but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster   You shall return from the playground  all of you  said Dr  Middleton   one quarter of an hour sooner  for two months to come  than the rest of your companions  A bell shall ring at the appointed time  I give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality   Oh  sir  we will come the instant  the very instant the bell rings  you shall have confidence in us  cried they  eagerly   I deserve your confidence  I hope  said Dr  Middleton   for it is my first wish to make you all happy  You do not know the pain that it has cost me to deprive you of food for so many hours  Here the boys  with one accord  ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies  Archer delivered them up to the doctor  proud to show that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity   The reason  resumed Dr  Middleton  having now returned to the usual benignity of his manner  the reason why I desired that none of you should go to that building  pointing out of the window   was this  I had been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept there the night before I spoke to you  one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid fever  I did not choose to mention my reason to you or your friends  I have had the place cleaned  and you may return to it when you please  The gipsies were yesterday removed from the town   De Grey  you were in the right  whispered Archer   and it was I that was UNJUST   The old woman  continued the doctor   whom you employed to buy food  has escaped the fever  but she has not escaped a gaol  whither she was sent yesterday  for having defrauded you of your money   Mr  Fisher  said Dr  Middleton   as to you  I shall not punish you  I have no hope of making you either wiser or better  Do you know this paper  the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder  box   I desired him to buy those things  sir  said Archer  colouring   And did you desire him not to pay for them   No  said Archer   he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them   I know he had  but he chose to apply it to his private use  and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating  To obtain credit for the tinder  box and candles  he made use of THIS name  said he  turning to the other side of the bill  and pointing to De Grey  s name  which was written at the end of a copy of one of De Grey  s exercises   I assure you  sir  cried Archer   You need not assure me  sir  said Dr  Middleton   I cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part in so base an action  When the people in the shop refused to let Mr  Fisher have the things without paying for them  he made use of De Grey  s name  who was known there  Suspecting some mischief  however  from the purchase of the tinder  box  the shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance  Nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as I felt  for a moment  when I suspected that De Grey was concerned in it  A loud cry  in which Archer  s voice was heard most distinctly  declared De Grey  s innocence  Dr  Middleton looked round at their eager  honest faces  with benevolent approbation   Archer  said he  taking him by the hand   I am heartily glad to see that you have got the better of your party spirit  I wish you may keep such a friend as you have now beside you  one such friend is worth two such parties  As for you  Mr  Fisher  depart  you must never return hither again  In vain he solicited Archer and De Grey to intercede for him  Everybody turned away with contempt  and he sneaked out  whimpering in a doleful voice   What shall I say to my Aunt Barbara  THE BRACELETS  In a beautiful and retired part of England lived Mrs  Villars  a lady whose accurate understanding  benevolent heart  and steady temper peculiarly fitted her for the most difficult  as well as most important  of all occupations  the education of youth  This task she had undertaken  and twenty young persons were put under her care  with the perfect confidence of their parents  No young people could be happier  they were good and gay  emulous  but not envious of each other  for Mrs  Villars was impartially just  her praise they felt to be the reward of merit  and her blame they knew to be the necessary consequence of ill  conduct  To the one  therefore  they patiently submitted  and in the other consciously rejoiced  They rose with fresh cheerfulness in the morning  eager to pursue their various occupations  They returned in the evening with renewed ardour to their amusements  and retired to rest satisfied with themselves and pleased with each other  Nothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this little society as a small honorary distinction  given annually  as a prize of successful application  The prize this year was peculiarly dear to each individual  as it was the picture of a friend whom they dearly loved  It was the picture of Mrs  Villars in a small bracelet  It wanted neither gold  pearls nor precious stones to give it value  The two foremost candidates for this prize were Cecilia and Leonora  Cecilia was the most intimate friend of Leonora  but Leonora was only the favourite companion of Cecilia  Cecilia was of an active  ambitious  enterprising disposition  more eager in the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her wishes  Leonora was of a contented  unaspiring temperate character  not easily roused to action  but indefatigable when once excited  Leonora was proud  Cecilia was vain  Her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of others  and therefore more anxious to please than Leonora  but that very vanity made her  at the same time  more apt to offend  In short  Leonora was the most anxious to avoid what was wrong  Cecilia  the most ambitious to do what was right  Few of her companions loved  but many were led by Cecilia  for she was often successful  Many loved Leonora  but none were ever governed by her  for she was too indolent to govern  On the first day of May  about six o  clock in the evening  a great bell rang  to summon this little society into a hall  where the prize was to be decided  A number of small tables were placed in a circle in the middle of the hall  Seats for the young competitors were raised one above another  in a semicircle  some yards distant from the table  and the judges  chairs  under canopies of lilacs and laburnums  forming another semicircle  closed the amphitheatre  Everyone put their writings  their drawings  their works of various kinds upon the tables appropriated for each  How unsteady were the last steps to these tables  How each little hand trembled as it laid down its claims  Till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success  and the heart  which exulted with hope  now palpitated with fear  The works were examined  the preference adjudged  and the prize was declared to be the happy Cecilia  s  Mrs  Villars came forward  smiling  with the bracelet in her hand  Cecilia was behind her companions  on the highest row  All the others gave way  and she was on the floor in an instant  Mrs  Villars clasped the bracelet on her arm  the clasp was heard through the whole hall  and a universal smile of congratulation followed  Mrs  Villars kissed Cecilia  s little hand   And now  said she   go and rejoice with your companions  the remainder of the day is yours  Oh  you whose hearts are elated with success  whose bosoms beat high with joy in the moment of triumph  command yourselves  Let that triumph be moderate  that it may be lasting  Consider  that though you are good  you may be better  and  though wise  you may be weak  As soon as Mrs  Villars had given her the bracelet  all Cecilia  s little companions crowded round her  and they all left the hall in an instant  She was full of spirits and vanity  She ran on  Running down the flight of steps which led to the garden  in her violent haste  Cecilia threw down the little Louisa  who had a china mandarin in her hand  which her mother had sent her that very morning  and which was all broken to pieces by her fall   Oh  my mandarin  cried Louisa  bursting into tears  The crowd behind Cecilia suddenly stopped  Louisa sat on the lowest step  fixing her eyes upon the broken pieces  Then  turning round  she hid her face in her hands upon the step above her  In turning  Louisa threw down the remains of the mandarin  The head  which she placed in the socket  fell from the shoulders  and rolled  bounding along the gravel walk  Cecilia pointed to the head and to the socket  and burst into laughter  The crowd behind laughed  too  At any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with Louisa  but Cecilia had just been successful  and sympathy with the victorious often makes us forget justice  Leonora  however  preserved her usual consistency   Poor Louisa  said she  looking first at her  and then reproachfully at Cecilia  Cecilia turned sharply round  colouring  half with shame and half with vexation   I could not help it  Leonora  said she   But you could have helped laughing  Cecilia   I didn  t laugh at Louisa  and I surely may laugh  for it does nobody any harm   I am sure  however  replied Leonora   I should not have laughed if I had   No  to be sure  you wouldn  t  because Louisa is your favourite  I can buy her another mandarin when the old peddler comes to the door  if that  s all  I CAN do no more  CAN I  said she  again turning round to her companions   No  to be sure  said they   that  s all fair  Cecilia looked triumphantly at Leonora  Leonora let go her hand  she ran on  and the crowd followed  When she got to the end of the garden  she turned round to see if Leonora had followed her  too  but was vexed to see her still sitting on the steps with Louisa   I  m sure I can do no more than buy her another  CAN I  said she  again appealing to her companions   No  to be sure  said they  eager to begin their play  How many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave off  before Cecilia could be satisfied with any  Her thoughts were discomposed  and her mind was running upon something else  No wonder  then  that she did not play with her usual address  She grew still more impatient  She threw down the ninepins   Come  let us play at something else  at threading the needle  said she  holding out her hand  They all yielded to the hand which wore the bracelet  But Cecilia  dissatisfied with herself  was discontented with everybody else  Her tone grew more and more peremptory  One was too rude  another too stiff  one too slow  another too quick  in short everything went wrong  and everybody was tired of her humours  The triumph of SUCCESS is absolute  but short  Cecilia  s companions at length recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip  and painted a peach  better than they  yet that they could play as well  and keep their tempers better  for she was discomposed  Walking towards the house in a peevish mood  Cecilia met Leonora  but passed on   Cecilia  cried Leonora   Well  what do you want with me   Are we friends   You know best  said Cecilia   We are  if you will let me tell Louisa that you are sorry  Cecilia  interrupting her   Oh  pray let me hear no more about Louisa   What  not confess that you were in the wrong  Oh  Cecilia  I had a better opinion of you   Your opinion is of no consequence to me now  for you don  t love me   No  not when you are unjust  Cecilia   Unjust  I am not unjust  and if I were  you are not my governess   No  but am not I your friend   I don  t desire to have such a friend  who would quarrel with me for happening to throw down little Louisa  How could I tell that she had a mandarin in her hand  and when it was broken  could I do more than promise her another  was that unjust   But you know  Cecilia   I KNOW  ironically   I know  Leonora  that you love Louisa better than you love me  that  s the injustice   If I did  replied Leonora  gravely   it would be no injustice  if she deserved it better   How can you compare Louisa to me  exclaimed Cecilia  indignantly  Leonora made no answer  for she was really hurt at her friend  s conduct  She walked on to join the rest of her companions  They were dancing in a round upon the grass  Leonora declined dancing  but they prevailed upon her to sing for them  Her voice was not so sprightly  but it was sweeter than usual  Who sang so sweetly as Leonora  or who danced so nimbly as Louisa  Away she was flying  all spirits and gaiety  when Leonora  s eyes full of tears  caught hers  Louisa silently let go her companion  s hand  and  quitting the dance  ran up to Leonora to inquire what was the matter with her   Nothing  replied she   that need interrupt you  Go  my dear  go and dance again  Louisa immediately ran away to her garden  and pulling off her little straw hat  she lined it with the freshest strawberry  leaves  and was upon her knees before the strawberry  bed when Cecilia came by  Cecilia was not disposed to be pleased with Louisa at that instant  for two reasons  because she was jealous of her  and because she had injured her  The injury  however  Louisa had already forgotten  Perhaps to tell things just as they were  she was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as she would have been before the fall of her mandarin  but this was the utmost extent of her malice  if it can be called malice   What are you doing there  little one  said Cecilia  in a sharp tone   Are you eating your early strawberries here all alone   No  said Louisa  mysteriously   I am not eating them   What are you doing with them  can  t you answer  then  I  m not playing with you  child   Oh  as to that  Cecilia  you know I need not answer you unless I choose it  not but what I would if you would only ask me civilly  and if you would not call me CHILD   Why should not I call you child   Because  because  I don  t know  but I wish you would stand out of my light  Cecilia  for you are trampling upon all my strawberries   I have not touched one  you covetous little creature   Indeed  indeed  Cecilia  I am not covetous  I have not eaten one of them  they are all for your friend Leonora  See how unjust you are   Unjust  that  s a cant word which you learnt of my friend Leonora  as you call her  but she is not my friend now   Not your friend now  exclaimed Louisa   then I am sure you must have done something VERY naughty   How  cried Cecilia  catching hold of her   Let me go  let me go  cried Louisa  struggling   I won  t give you one of my strawberries  for I don  t like you at all   You don  t  don  t you  cried Cecilia  provoked  and  catching the hat from Louisa  she flung the strawberries over the hedge   Will nobody help me  exclaimed Louisa  snatching her hat again  and running away with all her force   What have I done  said Cecilia  recollecting herself   Louisa  Louisa  she called very loud  but Louisa would not turn back  she was running to her companions  who were still dancing  hand in hand  upon the grass  whilst Leonora  sitting in the middle  was singing to them   Stop  stop  and hear me  cried Louisa  breaking through them  and  rushing up to Leonora  she threw her hat at her feet  and panting for breath  It was full  almost full of my own strawberries  said she   the first I ever got out of my garden  They should all have been for you  Leonora  but now I have not one left  They are all gone  said she  and she hid her face in Leonora  s lap   Gone  gone where  said everyone  at once running up to her   Cecilia  Cecilia  said she  sobbing   Cecilia  repeated Leonora   what of Cecilia   Yes  it was  it was   Come with me  said Leonora  unwilling to have her friend exposed   Come  and I will get you some more strawberries   Oh  I don  t mind the strawberries  indeed  but I wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you  Leonora took her up in her arms to carry her away  but it was too late   What  Cecilia  Cecilia  who won the prize  It could not surely be Cecilia  whispered every busy tongue  At this instant the bell summoned them in   There she is  There she is  cried they  pointing to an arbour  where Cecilia was standing ashamed and alone  and  as they passed her  some lifted up their hands and eyes with astonishment  others whispered and huddled mysteriously together  as if to avoid her  Leonora walked on  her head a little higher than usual   Leonora  said Cecilia  timorously  as she passed   Oh  Cecilia  who would have thought that you had a bad heart  Cecilia turned her head aside and burst into tears   Oh  no  indeed  she has not a bad heart  cried Louisa  running up to her and throwing her arms around her neck   She  s very sorry  are not you  Cecilia  But don  t cry any more  for I forgive you  with all my heart  and I love you now  though I said I did not when I was in a passion   Oh  you sweet  tempered girl  how I love you  said Cecilia  kissing her   Well  then  if you do  come along with me  and dry your eyes  for they are so red   Go  my dear  and I  ll come presently   Then I will keep a place for you  next to me  but you must make haste  or you will have to come in when we have all sat down to supper  and then you will be so stared at  So don  t stay  now  Cecilia followed Louisa with her eyes till she was out of sight   And is Louisa  said she  to herself   the only one who would stop to pity me  Mrs  Villars told me that this day should be mine  She little thought how it would end  Saying these words  Cecilia threw herself down upon the ground  her arm leaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning  and which  in the pride and gaiety of her heart  she had called her throne  At this instant  Mrs  Villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the evening  and  passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay  she started  Cecilia rose hastily   Who is there  said Mrs  Villars   It is I  madam   And who is _I_   Cecilia   Why  what keeps you here  my dear  Where are your companions  This is  perhaps  one of the happiest days of your life   Oh  no  madam  said Cecilia  hardly able to repress her tears   Why  my dear  what is the matter  Cecilia hesitated   Speak  my dear  You know that when I ask you to tell me anything as your friend  I never punish you as your governess  therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter   No  madam  I am not afraid  but ashamed  You asked me why I was not with my companions  Why  madam  because they have all left me  and   And what  my dear   And I see that they all dislike me  and yet I don  t know why they should  for I take as much pains to please as any of them  All my masters seem satisfied with me  and you yourself  madam  were pleased this very morning to give me this bracelet  and I am sure you would not have given it to anyone who did not deserve it   Certainly not  said Mrs  Villars   You well deserve it for your application  for your successful application  The prize was for the most assiduous  not for the most amiable   Then  if it had been for the most amiable  it would not have been for me  Mrs  Villars  smiling  Why  what do you think yourself  Cecilia  You are better able to judge than I am  I can determine whether or no you apply to what I give you to learn  whether you attend to what I desire you to do  and avoid what I desire you not to do  I know that I like you as a pupil  but I cannot know that I should like you as a companion  unless I were your companion  Therefore I must judge of what I should do  by seeing what others do in the same circumstances   Oh  pray don  t  madam  for then you would not love me either  And yet I think you would love me  for I hope that I am as ready to oblige  and as good  natured as   Yes  Cecilia  I don  t doubt but that you would be very good natured to me  but I  m afraid that I should not like you unless you were good  tempered  too   But  madam  by good  natured I mean good  tempered  it  s all the same thing   No  indeed  I understand by them two very different things  You are good  natured  Cecilia  for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions  to gain them praise  and save them from blame  to give them pleasure  and relieve them from pain  but Leonora is good  tempered  for she can bear with their foibles  and acknowledge her own  Without disputing about the right  she sometimes yields to those who are in the wrong  In short  her temper is perfectly good  for it can bear and forbear   I wish that mine could  said Cecilia  sighing   It may  replied Mrs  Villars   but it is not wishes alone which can improve us in anything  Turn the same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize to  day to this object  and you will meet with the same success  perhaps not on the first  the second  or the third attempt  but depend upon it that you will at last  Every new effort will weaken your bad habits  and strengthen your good ones  But you must not expect to succeed all at once  I repeat it to you  for habit must be counteracted by habit  It would be as extravagant in us to expect that all our faults could be destroyed by one punishment  were it ever so severe  as it was in the Roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago  to wish that all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck  that he might cut them off at one blow  Here Mrs  Villars took Cecilia by the hand  and they began to walk home  Such was the nature of Cecilia  s mind  that when any object was forcibly impressed on her imagination  it caused a temporary suspension of her reasoning faculties  Hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits  and when fear did take possession of her mind  it was attended with total debility  Her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had been elated  She walked on with Mrs  Villars in silence  until they came under the shade of the elm  tree walk  and there  fixing her eyes upon Mrs  Villars  she stopped short   Do you think  madam  said she  with hesitation  do you think  madam  that I have a bad heart   A bad heart  my dear  why  what put that into your head   Leonora said that I had  madam  and I felt ashamed when she said so   But  my dear  how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad  However  in the first place  tell me what you mean by a bad heart   Indeed I do not know what is meant by it  madam  but it is something which everybody hates   And why do they hate it   Because they think that it will hurt them  ma  am  I believe  and that those who have bad hearts take delight in doing mischief  and that they never do anybody any good but for their own ends   Then the best definition  said Mrs  Villars   which you can give me of a bad heart is  that it is some constant propensity to hurt others  and to do wrong for the sake of doing wrong   Yes  madam  but that is not all either  There is still something else meant  something which I cannot express  which  indeed  I never distinctly understood  but of which  therefore  I was the more afraid   Well  then  to begin with what you do understand  tell me  Cecilia  do you really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of wickedness  No human being becomes wicked all at once  A man begins by doing wrong because it is  or because he thinks it  for his interest  If he continue to do so  he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his love of virtue  But how can you  Cecilia  who feel such a strong sense of shame  and such an eager desire to improve  imagine that you have a bad heart   Indeed  madam  I never did  until everybody told me so  and then I began to be frightened about it  This very evening  madam  when I was in a passion  I threw little Louisa  s strawberries away  which  I am sure  I was very sorry for afterwards  and Leonora and everybody cried out that I had a bad heart  but I am sure I was only in a passion   Very likely  And when you are in a passion  as you call it  Cecilia  you see that you are tempted to do harm to others  If they do not feel angry themselves  they do not sympathize with you  They do not perceive the motive which actuates you  and then they say that you have a bad heart  I daresay  however  when your passion is over  and when you recollect yourself  you are very sorry for what you have done and said  are not you   Yes  indeed  madam  very sorry   Then make that sorry of use to you  Cecilia  and fix it steadily in your thoughts  as you hope to be good and happy  that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every occasion  anger and its consequences will become familiar to your mind  and  in the same proportion  your sense of shame will be weakened  till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice  then you would  indeed  according to our definition  have a bad heart   Oh  madam  I hope  I am sure I never shall   No  indeed  Cecilia  I do  indeed  believe that you never will  on the contrary  I think that you have a very good disposition  and what is of infinitely more consequence to you  an active desire of improvement  Show me that you have as much perseverance as you have candour  and I shall not despair of your becoming everything that I could wish  Here Cecilia  s countenance brightened  and she ran up the steps in almost as high spirits as she ran down them in the morning   Good  night to you  Cecilia  said Mrs  Villars  as she was crossing the hall   Good  night to you  madam  said Cecilia  and she ran upstairs to bed  She could not go to sleep  but she lay awake  reflecting upon the events of the preceding day  and forming resolutions for the future  at the same time that she had resolved  and resolved without effect  she wished to give her mind some more powerful motive  Ambition she knew to be its most powerful incentive   Have I not  said she to herself   already won the prize of application  and cannot the same application procure me a much higher prize  Mrs  Villars said that if the prize had been promised to the most amiable  it would not have been given to me  Perhaps it would not yesterday  perhaps it might not to  morrow  but that is no reason that I should despair of ever deserving it  In consequence of this reasoning  Cecilia formed a design of proposing to her companions that they should give a prize  the first of the ensuing month ( the lst of June ) to the most amiable  Mrs  Villars applauded the scheme  and her companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity   Let the prize  said they   be a bracelet of our own hair  and instantly their shining scissors were produced  and each contributed a lock of their hair  They formed the most beautiful gradation of colours  from the palest auburn to the brightest black  Who was to have the honour of plaiting them  was now the question  Caroline begged that she might  as she could plait very neatly  she said  Cecilia  however  was equally sure that she could do it much better  and a dispute would have inevitably ensued  if Cecilia  recollecting herself just as her colour rose to scarlet  had not yielded  yielded  with no very good grace indeed  but as well as could be expected for the first time  For it is habit which confers ease  and without ease  even in moral actions  there can be no grace  The bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by Caroline  finished round the edge with silver twist  and on it was worked  in the smallest silver letters  this motto   TO THE MOST AMIABLE  The moment it was completed  everybody begged to try it on  It fastened with little silver clasps  and as it was made large enough for the eldest girls  it was too large for the youngest  Of this they bitterly complained  and unanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them   How foolish  exclaimed Cecilia   don  t you perceive that if any of you win it  you have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from the edge  but if we get it  we can  t make it larger   Very true  said they   but you need not to have called us foolish  Cecilia  It was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that Cecilia offended  A slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in the effect  Cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could gain by the greatest particular exertions  How far she succeeded in curing herself of this defect  how far she became deserving of the bracelet  and to whom the bracelet was given  shall be told in the History of the First of June   The First of June was now arrived  and all the young competitors were in a state of the most anxious suspense  Leonora and Cecilia continued to be the foremost candidates  Their quarrel had never been finally adjusted  and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a reconciliation  Cecilia  though she was capable of acknowledging any of her faults in public before all her companions  could not humble herself in private to Leonora  Leonora was her equal  they were her inferiors  and submission is much easier to a vain mind  where it appears to be voluntary  than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or candour  So strongly did Cecilia feel this truth  that she even delayed making any apology  or coming to any explanation with Leonora  until success should once more give her the palm   If I win the bracelet  to  day  said she to herself   I will solicit the return of Leonora  s friendship  it will be more valuable to me than even the bracelet  and at such a time  and asked in such a manner  she surely cannot refuse it to me  Animated with this hope of a double triumph  Cecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity  By constant attention and exertion she had considerably abated the violence of her temper  and changed the course of her habits  Her powers of pleasing were now excited  instead of her abilities to excel  and  if her talents appeared less brilliant  her character was acknowledged to be more amiable  So great an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our ambition  Cecilia was now  if possible  more than ever desirous of doing what was right  but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of doing wrong  This was the fundamental error of her mind  it arose in a great measure from her early education  Her mother died when she was very young  and though her father had supplied her place in the best and kindest manner  he had insensibly infused into his daughter  s mind a portion of that enterprising  independent spirit which he justly deemed essential to the character of her brother  This brother was some years older than Cecilia  but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth  What her father  s precepts inculcated  his example enforced  and even Cecilia  s virtues consequently became such as were more estimable in a man than desirable in a female  All small objects and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles  and her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more material faults  yet her candour in confessing these  she had been suffered to believe  was sufficient reparation and atonement  Leonora  on the contrary  who had been educated by her mother in a manner more suited to her sex  had a character and virtues more peculiar to a female  Her judgment had been early cultivated  and her good sense employed in the regulation of her conduct  She had been habituated to that restraint  which  as a woman  she was to expect in life  and early accustomed to yield  Compliance in her seemed natural and graceful  yet notwithstanding the gentleness of her temper  she was in reality more independent than Cecilia  She had more reliance upon her own judgment  and more satisfaction in her own approbation  The uniform kindness of her manner  the consistency and equality of her character  had fixed the esteem and passive love of her companions  By passive love we mean that species of affection which makes us unwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige  which is more a habit than an emotion of the mind  For Cecilia her companions felt active love  for she was active in showing her love to them  Active love arises spontaneously in the mind  after feeling particular instances of kindness  without reflection on the past conduct or general character  It exceeds the merits of its object  and is connected with a feeling of generosity  rather than with a sense of justice  Without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others  we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds  We give our hearts more credit for being generous than for being just  and we feel more self  complacency when we give our love voluntarily  than when we yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold  Though Cecilia  s companions might not know all this in theory  they proved it in practice  for they loved her in a much higher proportion to her merits than they loved Leonora  Each of the young judges were to signify their choice by putting a red or a white shell into a vase prepared for the purpose  Cecilia  s colour was red  Leonora  s white  In the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells  nothing talked of but the long expected event of the evening  Cecilia  following Leonora  s example  had made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual her vote  previously to their final determination  They were both sitting together in Louisa  s room  Louisa was recovering from the measles  Everyone during her illness had been desirous of attending her  but Leonora and Cecilia were the only two that were permitted to see her  as they alone had had the distemper  They were both assiduous in their care of Louisa  but Leonora  s want of exertion to overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of presence of mind  and prevented her from being so constantly useful as Cecilia  Cecilia  on the contrary  often made too much noise and bustle with her officious assistance  and was too anxious to invent amusements and procure comforts for Louisa  without perceiving that illness takes away the power of enjoying them  As she was sitting at the window in the morning  exerting herself to entertain Louisa  she heard the voice of an old peddler who often used to come to the house  Downstairs they ran immediately  to ask Mrs  Villars  permission to bring him into the hall  Mrs  Villars consented  and away Cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions  Then  first returning into the hall  she found the peddler just unbuckling his box  and taking it off his shoulders   What would you be pleased to want  miss  said the peddler   I  ve all kinds of tweezer  cases  rings  and lockets of all sorts  continued he  opening all the glittering drawers successively   Oh  said Cecilia  shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her most   these are not the things which I want  Have you any china figures  any mandarins   Alack  a  day  miss  I had a great stock of that same chinaware  but now I  m quite out of them kind of things  but I believe  said he  rummaging one of the deepest drawers   I believe I have one left  and here it is   Oh  that is the very thing  what  s its price   Only three shillings  ma  am  Cecilia paid the money  and was just going to carry off the mandarin  when the peddler took out of his great  coat pocket a neat mahogany case  It was about a foot long  and fastened at each end by two little clasps  It had besides  a small lock in the middle   What is that  said Cecilia  eagerly   It  s only a china figure  miss  which I am going to carry to an elderly lady  who lives nigh hand  and who is mighty fond of such things   Could you let me look at it   And welcome  miss  said he  and opened the case   Oh  goodness  how beautiful  exclaimed Cecilia  It was a figure of Flora  crowned with roses  and carrying a basket of flowers in her hand  Cecilia contemplated it with delight   How I should like to give this to Louisa  said she to herself  and  at last  breaking silence   Did you promise it to the old lady   Oh  no  miss  I didn  t promise it  she never saw it  and if so be that you  d like to take it  I  d make no more words about it   And how much does it cost   Why  miss  as to that  I  ll let you have it for half  a  guinea  Cecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her treasure  and  emptying it upon the table  she began to count the shillings  Alas  there were but six shillings   How provoking  said she   then I can  t have it  Where  s the mandarin  Oh  I have it  said she  taking it up  and looking at it with the utmost disgust   Is this the same that I had before   Yes  miss  the very same  replied the peddler  who  during this time  had been examining the little box out of which Cecilia had taken her money  it was of silver   Why  ma  am  said he   since you  ve taken such a fancy to the piece  if you  ve a mind to make up the remainder of the money  I will take this here little box  if you care to part with it  Now this box was a keepsake from Leonora to Cecilia   No  said Cecilia hastily  blushing a little  and stretching out her hand to receive it   Oh  miss  said he  returning it carelessly   I hope there  s no offence  I meant but to serve you  that  s all  Such a rare piece of china  work has no cause to go a  begging  added he  Then  putting the Flora deliberately into the case  and turning the key with a jerk  he let it drop into his pocket  when  lifting up his box by the leather straps  he was preparing to depart   Oh  stay one minute  said Cecilia  in whose mind there had passed a very warm conflict during the peddler  s harangue   Louisa would so like this Flora  said she  arguing with herself   Besides  it would be so generous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly mandarin  that would be doing only common justice  for I promised it to her  and she expects it  Though  when I come to look at this mandarin  it is not even so good as hers was  The gilding is all rubbed off  so that I absolutely must buy this for her  Oh  yes  I will  and she will be so delighted  and then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw  and the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever  Here Cecilia  s hand moved  and she was just going to decide   Oh  but stop  said she to herself   consider  Leonora gave me this box  and it is a keepsake  However  we have now quarrelled  and I dare say that she would not mind my parting with it  I  m sure that I should not care if she was to give away my keepsake  the smelling  bottle  or the ring which I gave her  Then what does it signify  Besides  is it not my own  and have I not a right to do what I please with it  At this moment  so critical for Cecilia  a party of her companions opened the door  She knew that they came as purchasers  and she dreaded her Flora  s becoming the prize of some higher bidder   Here  said she  hastily putting the box into the peddler  s hand  without looking at it   take it  and give me the Flora  Her hand trembled  though she snatched it impatiently  She ran by  without seeming to mind any of her companions  Let those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future gratification  or the prospect of certain concealment and impunity  remember that  unless they are totally depraved  they bear in their own hearts a monitor  who will prevent their enjoying what they ill obtained  In vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions  to display her present  in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self  complacency  in vain she saw the Flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand  each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver  Cecilia was still displeased with herself  with them  and even with their praise  From Louisa  s gratitude  however  she yet expected much pleasure  and immediately she ran upstairs to her room  In the meantime  Leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin  she had just broken hers  In giving her change  the peddler took out of his pocket  with some halfpence  the very box which Cecilia had sold to him  Leonora did not in the least suspect the truth  for her mind was above suspicion  and besides  she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia   I should like to have that box  said she   for it is like one of which I was very fond  The peddler named the price  and Leonora took the box  She intended to give it to little Louisa  On going to her room she found her asleep  and she sat softly down by her bedside  Louisa opened her eyes   I hope I didn  t disturb you  said Leonora   Oh  no  I didn  t hear you come in  but what have you got there   Only a little box  would you like to have it  I bought on purpose for you  as I thought perhaps it would please you  because it  s like that which I gave Cecilia   Oh  yes  that out of which she used to give me Barbary drops  I am very much obliged to you  I always thought that exceedingly pretty  and this  indeed  is as like it as possible  I can  t unscrew it  will you try  Leonora unscrewed it   Goodness  exclaimed Louisa   this must be Cecilia  s box  Look  don  t you see a great L at the bottom of it  Leonora  s colour changed   Yes  she replied calmly   I see that  but it is no proof that it is Cecilia  s  You know that I bought this box just now of the peddler   That may be  said Louisa   but I remember scratching that L with my own needle  and Cecilia scolded me for it  too  Do go and ask her if she has lost her box  do  repeated Louisa  pulling her by the ruffle  as she did not seem to listen  Leonora  indeed  did not hear  for she was lost in thought  She was comparing circumstances  which had before escaped her attention  She recollected that Cecilia had passed her as she came into the hall  without seeming to see her  but had blushed as she passed  She remembered that the peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box  and was going to put it again in his pocket with the halfpence   And why should he keep it in his pocket  and not show it with his other things  Combining all these circumstances  Leonora had no longer any doubt of the truth  for though she had honourable confidence in her friends  she had too much penetration to be implicitly credulous   Louisa  she began  but at this instant she heard a step  which  by its quickness  she knew to be Cecilia  s  coming along the passage   If you love me  Louisa  said Leonora   say nothing about the box   Nay  but why not  I daresay she had lost it   No  my dear  I  m afraid she has not  Louisa looked surprised   But I have reasons for desiring you not to say anything about it   Well  then  I won  t  indeed  Cecilia opened the door  came forward smiling  as if secure of a good reception  and taking the Flora out of the case  she placed it on the mantlepiece  opposite to Louisa  s bed   Dear  how beautiful  cried Louisa  starting up   Yes  said Cecilia   and guess who it  s for   For me  perhaps  said the ingenuous Louisa   Yes  take it  and keep it  for my sake  You know that I broke your mandarin   Oh  but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that   Yes  I know it is  and I meant that it should be so  I should only have done what I was bound to do if I had only given you a mandarin   Well  replied Louisa   and that would have been enough  surely  but what a beautiful crown of roses  and then that basket of flowers  they almost look as if I could smell them  Dear Cecilia  I  m very much obliged to you  but I won  t take it by way of payment for the mandarin you broke  for I  m sure you could not help that  and  besides  I should have broken it myself by this time  You shall give it to me entirely  and as your keepsake  I  ll keep it as long as I live  Louisa stopped short and coloured  the word keepsake recalled the box to her mind  and all the train of ideas which the Flora had banished   But  said she  looking up wistfully in Cecilia  s face  and holding the Flora doubtfully   did you  Leonora  who was just quitting the room  turned her head back  and gave Louisa a look  which silenced her  Cecilia was so infatuated with her vanity  that she neither perceived Leonora  s sign nor Louisa  s confusion  but continued showing off her present  by placing it in various situations  till at length she put it into the case  and laying it down with an affected carelessness upon the bed   I must go now  Louisa  Good  bye  said she  running up and kissing her   but I  ll come again presently  then  clapping the door after her she went  But as soon as the formentation of her spirits subsided  the sense of shame  which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many other sensations  rose uppermost in her mind   What  said she to herself   is it possible that I have sold what I promised to keep for ever  and what Leonora gave me  and I have concealed it too  and have been making a parade of my generosity  Oh  what would Leonora  what would Louisa  what would everybody think of me  if the truth were known  Humiliated and grieved by these reflections  Cecilia began to search in her own mind for some consoling idea  She began to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age  and at length  fixing her comparison upon her brother George  as the companion of whom  from her infancy  she had been habitually the most emulous  she recollected that an almost similar circumstance had once happened to him  and that he had not only escaped disgrace  but had acquired glory  by an intrepid confession of his fault  Her father  s word to her brother  on the occasion  she also perfectly recollected   Come to me  George  he said holding out his hand   you are a generous  brave boy  they who dare to confess their faults will make great and good men  These were his words  but Cecilia  in repeating them to herself  forgot to lay that emphasis on the word MEN  which would have placed it in contradistinction to the word WOMEN  She willingly believed that the observation extended equally to both sexes  and flattered herself that she should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault  which she thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess   Yes  but  said she  stopping herself   how can I confess it  This very evening  in a few hours  the prize will be decided  Leonora or I shall win it  I have now as good a chance as Leonora  perhaps a better  and must I give up all my hopes  all that I have been labouring for this month past  Oh  I never can  If it were but to  morrow  or yesterday  or any day but this  I would not hesitate  but now I am almost certain of the prize  and if I win it  well  why then I will  I think I will tell all  yes I will  I am determined  said Cecilia  Here a bell summoned them to dinner  Leonora sat opposite to her  and she was not a little surprised to see Cecilia look so gay and unconstrained   Surely  said she to herself   if Cecilia had done that which I suspect  she would not  she could not  look as she does  But Leonora little knew the cause of her gaiety  Cecilia was never in higher spirits  or better pleased with herself  than when she had resolved upon a sacrifice or a confession   Must not this evening be given to the most amiable  Whose  then  will it be  All eyes glanced first at Cecilia  and then at Leonora  Cecilia smiled  Leonora blushed   I see that it is not yet decided  said Mrs  Villars  and immediately they ran upstairs  amidst confused whisperings  Cecilia  s voice could be distinguished far above the rest   How can she be so happy  said Leonora to herself   Oh Cecilia  there was a time when you could not have neglected me so  when we were always together the best of friends and companions  our wishes  tastes  and pleasures the same  Surely she did once love me  said Leonora   but now she is quite changed  She has even sold my keepsake  and she would rather win a bracelet of hair from girls whom she did not always think so much superior to Leonora  than have my esteem  my confidence  and my friendship for her whole life  yes  for her whole life  for I am sure she will be an amiable woman  Oh  that this bracelet had never been thought of  or that I were certain of her winning it  for I am sure that I do not wish to win it from her  I would rather  a thousand times rather  that we were as we used to be than have all the glory in the world  And how pleasing Cecilia can be when she wishes to please  how candid she is  how much she can improve herself  Let me be just  though she has offended me  she is wonderfully improved within this last month  For one fault  and THAT against myself  shall I forget all her merits  As Leonora said these last words  she could but just hear the voices of her companions  They had left her alone in the gallery  She knocked softly at Louisa  s door   Come in  said Louisa   I  m not asleep  Oh  said she  starting up with the Flora in her hand  the instant that the door was opened   I  m so glad you are come  Leonora  for I did so long to hear what you all were making such a noise about  Have you forgot that the bracelet   Oh  yes  is this the evening  inquired Leonora   Well  here  s my white shell for you  said Louisa   I  ve kept it in my pocket this fortnight  and though Cecilia did give me this Flora  I still love you a great deal better   I thank you  Louisa  said Leonora  gratefully   I will take your shell  and I shall value it as long as I live  but here is a red one  and if you wish to show me that you love me  you will give this to Cecilia  I know that she is particularly anxious for your preference  and I am sure that she deserves it   Yes  if I could I would choose both of you  said Louisa   but you know I can only choose which I like the best   If you mean  my dear Louisa  said Leonora   that you like me the best  I am very much obliged to you  for  indeed  I wish you to love me  but it is enough for me to know it in private  I should not feel the least more pleasure at hearing it in public  or in having it made known to all my companions  especially at a time when it would give poor Cecilia a great deal of pain   But why should it give her pain  asked Louisa   I don  t like her for being jealous of you   Nay  Louisa  surely you don  t think Cecilia jealous  She only tries to excel  and to please  she is more anxious to succeed than I am  it is true  because she has a great deal more activity  and perhaps more ambition  And it would really mortify her to lose this prize  you know that she proposed it herself  It has been her object for this month past  and I am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it   But  dear Leonora  why should you lose it   Indeed  my dear  it would be no loss to me  and  if it were  I would willingly suffer it for Cecilia  for  though we seem not to be such good friends as we used to be  I love her very much  and she will love me again  I  m sure she will  when she no longer fears me as a rival  she will again love me as a friend  Here Leonora heard a number of her companions running along the gallery  They all knocked hastily at the door  calling  Leonora  Leonora  will you never come  Cecilia has been with us this half  hour  Leonora smiled   Well  Louisa  said she  smiling   will you promise me   Oh  I am sure  by the way they speak to you  that they won  t give you the prize  said the little Louisa  and the tears started into her eyes   They love me  though  for all that  said Leonora   and as for the prize  you know whom I wish to have it   Leonora  Leonora  called her impatient companions   don  t you hear us  What are you about   Oh  she never will take any trouble about anything  said one of the party   let  s go away   Oh  go  go  make haste  cried Louisa   don  t stay  they are so angry   Remember  then  that you have promised me  said Leonora  and she left the room  During all this time  Cecilia had been in the garden with her companions  The ambition which she had felt to win the first prize  the prize of superior talents and superior application  was not to be compared to the absolute anxiety which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of the love and approbation of her equals and rivals  To employ her exuberant activity  Cecilia had been dragging branches of lilacs and laburnums  roses and sweet briar  to ornament the bower in which her fate was to be decided  It was excessively hot  but her mind was engaged  and she was indefatigable  She stood still at last to admire her works  Her companions all joined in loud applause  They were not a little prejudiced in her favour by the great eagerness which she expressed to win their prize  and by the great importance which she seemed to affix to the preference of each individual  At last   Where is Leonora  cried one of them  and immediately  as we have seen  they ran to call her  Cecilia was left alone  Overcome with heat and too violent exertion  she had hardly strength to support herself  each moment appeared to her intolerably long  She was in a state of the utmost suspense  and all her courage failed her  Even hope forsook her  and hope is a cordial which leaves the mind depressed and enfeebled   The time is now come  said Cecilia   in a few moments all will be decided  In a few moments  goodness  How much do I hazard  If I should not win the prize  how shall I confess what I have done  How shall I beg Leonora to forgive me  I  who hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour  They are gone to seek for her  The moment she appears I shall be forgotten  What  what shall I do  said Cecilia  covering her face with her hands  Such was Cecilia  s situation when Leonora  accompanied by her companions  opened the hall door  They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia  As Leonora came into the bower  she held out her hand to Cecilia   We are not rivals  but friends  I hope  said she  Cecilia clasped her hand  but she was in too great agitation to speak  The table was now set in the arbour  the vase was now placed in the middle   Well  said Cecilia  eagerly   who begins  Caroline  one of her friends  came forward first  and then all the others successively  Cecilia  s emotion was hardly conceivable   Now they are all in  Count them  Caroline   One  two  three  four  the numbers are both equal  There was a dead silence   No  they are not  exclaimed Cecilia  pressing forward  and putting a shell into a vase   I have not given mine  and I give it to Leonora  Then  snatching the bracelet   It is yours  Leonora  said she   take it  and give me back your friendship  The whole assembly gave one universal clap and a general shout of applause   I cannot be surprised at this from you  Cecilia  said Leonora   and do you then still love me as you used to do   Oh  Leonora  stop  don  t praise me  I don  t deserve this  said she  turning to her loudly applauding companions   You will soon despise me  Oh  Leonora  you will never forgive me  I have deceived you  I have sold  At this instant  Mrs  Villars appeared  The crowd divided  She had heard all that passed  from her window   I applaud your generosity  Cecilia  said she   but I am to tell you that  in this instance it is unsuccessful  You have not it in your power to give the prize to Leonora  It is yours  I have another vote to give to you  You have forgotten Louisa   Louisa  exclaimed Cecilia   but surely  ma  am  Louisa loves Leonora better than she does me   She commissioned me  however  said Mrs  Villars   to give you a red shell  and you will find it in this box  Cecilia started  and turned as pale as death  it was the fatal box  Mrs  Villars produced another box  She opened it  it contained the Flora   And Louisa also desired me  said she   to return to you this Flora  She put it into Cecilia  s hand  Cecilia trembled so that she could not hold it  Leonora caught it   Oh  madam  Oh  Leonora  exclaimed Cecilia   now I have no hope left  I intended  I was just going to tell   Dear Cecilia  said Leonora   you need not tell it me  I know it already  and I forgive you with all my heart   Yes  I can prove to you  said Mrs  Villars   that Leonora has forgiven you  It is she who has given you the prize  it was she who persuaded Louisa to give you her vote  I went to see her a little while ago  and perceiving  by her countenance  that something was the matter  I pressed her to tell me what it was   Why  madam  said she   Leonora has made me promise to give my shell to Cecilia  Now I don  t love Cecilia half so well as I do Leonora  Besides  I would not have Cecilia think I vote for her because she gave me a Flora  Whilst Louisa was speaking  continued Mrs  Villars   I saw this silver box lying on the bed  I took it up  and asked if it was not yours  and how she came by it   Indeed  madam  said Louisa   I could have been almost certain that it was Cecilia  s  but Leonora gave it me  and she said that she bought it of the peddler this morning  If anybody else had told me so  I could not have believed them  because I remember the box so well  but I can  t help believing Leonora  But did not you ask Cecilia about it  said I   No  madam  replied Louisa   for Leonora forbade me  I guessed her reason  Well  said I  give me the box  and I will carry your shell in it to Cecilia   Then  madam  said she   if I must give it her  pray do take the Flora  and return it to her first  that she may not think it is for that I do it   Oh  generous Louisa  exclaimed Cecilia   but  indeed  Leonora  I cannot take your shell   Then  dear Cecilia  accept of mine instead of it  you cannot refuse it  I only follow your example  As for the bracelet  added Leonora  taking Cecilia  s hand   I assure you I don  t wish for it  and you do  and you deserve it   No  said Cecilia   indeed  I do not deserve it  Next to you  surely Louisa deserves it best   Louisa  oh  yes  Louisa  exclaimed everybody with one voice   Yes  said Mrs  Villars   and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her  she deserves that reward  For one fault I cannot forget all your merits  Cecilia  nor  I am sure  will your companions   Then  surely  not your best friend  said Leonora  kissing her  Everybody present was moved  They looked up to Leonora with respectful and affectionate admiration   Oh  Leonora  how I love you  and how I wish to be like you  exclaimed Cecilia  to be as good  as generous   Rather wish  Cecilia  interrupted Mrs  Villars   to be as just  to be as strictly honourable  and as invariably consistent  Remember  that many of our sex are capable of great efforts  of making what they call great sacrifices to virtue or to friendship  but few treat their friends with habitual gentleness  or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence and good sense  THE LITTLE MERCHANTS  CHAPTER I  Chi di gallina nasce  convien che rozole  As the old cock crows  so crows the young  Those who have visited Italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful industry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of Naples  Their manner of living and their numerous employments are exactly described in the following  Extract from a Traveller  s Journal    Varieties of Literature  vol  i  p     The children are busied in various ways  A great number of them bring fish for sale to town from Santa Lucia  others are very often seen about the arsenals  or wherever carpenters are at work  employed in gathering up the chips and pieces of wood  or by the sea  side  picking up sticks  and whatever else has drifted ashore  which  when their basket is full  they carry away   Children of two or three years old  who can scarcely crawl along upon the ground  in company with boys of five or six  are employed in this pretty trade  Hence they proceed with their baskets into the heart of the city  where in several places they form a sort of little market  sitting round with their stock of wood before them  Labourers  and the lower order of citizens  buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming themselves  or to use in their scanty kitchens   Other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells  which  particularly in the spring season  is drunk in great abundance  Others again endeavour to turn a few pence by buying a small matter of fruit  of pressed honey  cakes  and comfits  and then  like little peddlers  offer and sell them to other children  always for no more profit than that they may have their share of them free of expense   It is really curious to see how an urchin  whose whole stock and property consist in a board and a knife  will carry about a water  melon  or a half roasted gourd  collect a troup of children round him  set down his board  and proceed to divide the fruit into small pieces among them   The buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have enough for their little piece of copper  and the Lilliputian tradesmen act with no less caution as the exigencies of the case may require  to prevent his being cheated out of a morsel  The advantages of truth and honesty  and the value of a character for integrity  are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their daily intercourse with each other  The fair dealer is always sooner or later seen to prosper  The most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced  Numerous instances of the truth of this common observation were remarked by many Neapolitan children  especially by those who were acquainted with the characters and history of Piedro and Francisco  two boys originally equal in birth  fortune and capacity  but different in their education  and consequently in their habits and conduct  Francisco was the son of an honest gardener  who  from the time he could speak  taught him to love to speak the truth  showed him that liars are never believed  that cheats and thieves cannot be trusted  and that the shortest way to obtain a good character is to deserve it  Youth and white paper  as the proverb says  take all impressions  The boy profited much by his father  s precepts  and more by his example  he always heard his father speak the truth  and saw that he dealt fairly with everybody  In all his childish traffic  Francisco  imitating his parents  was scrupulously honest  and therefore all his companions trusted him  As honest as Francisco  became a sort of proverb amongst them   As honest as Francisco  repeated Piedro  s father  when he one day heard this saying   Let them say so  I say   As sharp as Piedro  and let us see which will go through the world best  With the idea of making his son SHARP he made him cunning  He taught him  that to make a GOOD BARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of  to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence  He often repeated his favourite proverb  The buyer has need of a hundred eyes  the seller has need but of one   And he took frequent opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his son  He was a fisherman  and as his gains depended more upon fortune than upon prudence  he trusted habitually to his good luck  After being idle for a whole day  he would cast his line or his nets  and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine fish  he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener   Chi compra ha bisogna di cent  occhi  chi vende n  ha assai di uno   You are obliged to work all day long for your daily bread  he would say   Look here  I work but five minutes  and I have not only daily bread  but daily fish  Upon these occasions  our fisherman always forgot  or neglected to count  the hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to sea  or angling in vain on the shore  Little Piedro  who used to bask in the sun upon the sea  shore beside his father  and to lounge or sleep away his time in a fishing  boat  acquired habits of idleness  which seemed to his father of little consequence whilst he was BUT A CHILD   What will you do with Piedro as he grows up  neighbour  said the gardener   He is smart and quick enough  but he is always in mischief  Scarcely a day has passed for this fortnight but I have caught him amongst my grapes  I track his footsteps all over my vineyard   HE IS BUT A CHILD yet  and knows no better  replied the fisherman   But if you don  t teach him better now he is a child  how will he know when he is a man  said the gardener   A mighty noise about a bunch of grapes  truly  cried the fisherman   a few grapes more or less in your vineyard  what does it signify   I speak for your son  s sake  and not for the sake of my grapes  said the gardener   and I tell you again  the boy will not do well in the world  neighbour  if you don  t look after him in time   He  ll do well enough in the world  you will find  answered the fisherman  carelessly   Whenever he casts my nets  they never come up empty   It is better to be lucky than wise    E meglio esser fortunato che savio  This was a proverb which Piedro had frequently heard from his father  and to which he most willingly trusted  because it gave him less trouble to fancy himself fortunate than to make himself wise   Come here  child  said his father to him  when he returned home after the preceding conversation with the gardener   how old are you  my boy  twelve years old  is not it   As old as Francisco  and older by six months  said Piedro   And smarter and more knowing by six years  said his father   Here  take these fish to Naples  and let us see how you  ll sell them for me  Venture a small fish  as the proverb says  to catch a great one   I was too late with them at the market yesterday  but nobody will know but what they are just fresh out of the water  unless you go and tell them   Butta una sardella per pigliar un luccio   Not I  trust me for that  I  m not such a fool  replied Piedro  laughing   I leave that to Francisco  Do you know  I saw him the other day miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to the customer  who was just laying down the money for it  and who was a raw servant  boy  moreover  one who would never have guessed there were two sides to a melon  if he had not  as you say  father  been told of it   Off with you to market  You are a droll chap  said his father   and will sell my fish cleverly  I  ll be bound  As to the rest  let every man take care of his own grapes  You understand me  Piedro   Perfectly  said the boy  who perceived that his father was indifferent as to his honesty  provided he sold fish at the highest price possible  He proceeded to the market  and he offered his fish with assiduity to every person whom he thought likely to buy it  especially to those upon whom he thought he could impose  He positively asserted to all who looked at his fish  that they were just fresh out of the water  Good judges of men and fish knew that he said what was false  and passed him by with neglect  but it was at last what he called GOOD LUCK to meet with the very same young raw servant  boy who would have bought the bruised melon from Francisco  He made up to him directly  crying   Fish  Fine fresh fish  fresh fish   Was it caught to  day  said the boy   Yes  this morning  not an hour ago  said Piedro  with the greatest effrontery  The servant  boy was imposed upon  and being a foreigner  speaking the Italian language but imperfectly  and not being expert at reckoning the Italian money  he was no match for the cunning Piedro  who cheated him not only as to the freshness  but as to the price of the commodity  Piedro received nearly half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done  On his road homewards from Naples to the little village of Resina  where his father lived  he overtook Francisco  who was leading his father  s ass  The ass was laden with large panniers  which were filled with the stalks and leaves of cauliflowers  cabbages  broccoli  lettuces  etc  all the refuse of the Neapolitan kitchens  which are usually collected by the gardeners  boys  and carried to the gardens round Naples  to be mixed with other manure   Well filled panniers  truly  said Piedro  as he overtook Francisco and the ass  The panniers were indeed not only filled to the top  but piled up with much skill and care  so that the load met over the animal  s back   It is not a very heavy load for the ass  though it looks so large  said Francisco   The poor fellow  however  shall have a little of this water  added he  leading the ass to a pool by the roadside   I was not thinking of the ass  boy  I was not thinking of any ass  but of you  when I said   Well filled panniers  truly  This is your morning  s work  I presume  and you  ll make another journey to Naples to  day  on the same errand  I warrant  before your father thinks you have done enough   Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough  but before I think so myself  replied Francisco   I do enough to satisfy myself and my father  too  said Piedro   without slaving myself after your fashion  Look here  producing the money he had received for the fish   all this was had for asking  It is no bad thing  you  ll allow  to know how to ask for money properly   I should be ashamed to beg  or borrow either  said Francisco   Neither did I get what you see by begging  or borrowing either  said Piedro   but by using my wits  not as you did yesterday  when  like a novice  you showed the bruised side of your melon  and so spoiled your market by your wisdom   Wisdom I think it still  said Francisco   And your father  asked Piedro   And my father  said Francisco   Mine is of a different way of thinking  said Piedro   He always tells me that the buyer has need of a hundred eyes  and if one can blind the whole hundred  so much the better  You must know  I got off the fish to  day that my father could not sell yesterday in the market  got it off for fresh just out of the river  got twice as much as the market price for it  and from whom  think you  Why  from the very booby that would have bought the bruised melon for a sound one if you would have let him  You  ll allow I  m no fool  Francisco  and that I  m in a fair way to grow rich  if I go on as I have begun   Stay  said Francisco   you forgot that the booby you took in to  day will not be so easily taken in to  morrow  He will buy no more fish from you  because he will be afraid of your cheating him  but he will be ready enough to buy fruit from me  because he will know I shall not cheat him  so you  ll have lost a customer  and I gained one   With all my heart  said Piedro   One customer does not make a market  if he buys no more from me  what care I  there are people enough to buy fish in Naples   And do you mean to serve them all in the same manner  asked Francisco   If they will be only so good as to give me leave  said Piedro  laughing  and repeating his father  s proverb   Venture a small fish to catch a large one   He had learned to think that to cheat in making bargains was witty and clever   see anted   And you have never considered  then  said Francisco   that all these people will  one after another  find you out in time   Ay  in time  but it will be some time first  There are a great many of them  enough to last me all the summer  if I lose a customer a day  said Piedro   And next summer  observed Francisco   what will you do   Next summer is not come yet  there is time enough to think what I shall do before next summer comes  Why  now  suppose the blockheads  after they had been taken in and found it out  all joined against me  and would buy none of our fish  what then  Are there no trades but that of a fisherman  In Naples  are there not a hundred ways of making money for a smart lad like me  as my father says  What do you think of turning merchant  and selling sugar  plums and cakes to the children in their market  Would they be hard to deal with  think you   I think not  said Francisco   but I think the children would find out in time if they were cheated  and would like it as little as the men   I don  t doubt them  Then IN TIME I could  you know  change my trade  sell chips and sticks in the wood  market  hand about the lemonade to the fine folks  or twenty other things  There are trades enough  boy   Yes  for the honest dealer  said Francisco   but for no other  for in all of them you  ll find  as MY father says  that a good character is the best fortune to set up with  Change your trade ever so often  you  ll be found out for what you are at last   And what am I  pray  said Piedro  angrily   The whole truth of the matter is  Francisco  that you envy my good luck  and can  t bear to hear this money jingle in my hand  Ay  stroke the long ears of your ass  and look as wise as you please  It  s better to be lucky than wise  as MY father says  Good morning to you  When I am found out for what I am  or when the worst comes to the worst  I can drive a stupid ass  with his panniers filled with rubbish  as well as you do now  HONEST FRANCISCO   Not quite so well  Unless you were HONEST FRANCISCO  you would not fill his panniers quite so readily  This was certain  that Francisco was so well known for his honesty amongst all the people at Naples with whom his father was acquainted  that everyone was glad to deal with him  and as he never wronged anyone  all were willing to serve him  at least  as much as they could without loss to themselves  so that after the market was over  his panniers were regularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted  His industry was constant  his gains small but certain  and he every day had more and more reason to trust to his father  s maxim  That honesty is the best policy  The foreign servant lad  to whom Francisco had so honestly  or  as Piedro said  so sillily  shown the bruised side of the melon  was an Englishman  He left his native country  of which he was extremely fond  to attend upon his master  to whom he was still more attached  His master was in a declining state of health  and this young lad waited on him a little more to his mind than his other servants  We must  in consideration of his zeal  fidelity and inexperience  pardon him for not being a good judge of fish  Though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once  he had too much sense to be twice made a dupe  The next time he met Piedro in the market  he happened to be in company with several English gentlemen  s servants  and he pointed Piedro out to them all as an arrant knave  They heard his cry of  Fresh fish  fresh fish  fine fresh fish  with incredulous smiles  and let him pass  but not without some expressions of contempt  though uttered in English  he tolerably well understood  for the tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive in all languages  He lost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the ENGLISH BOOBY  The market was well supplied  and he could not get rid of his cargo   Is not this truly provoking  said Piedro  as he passed by Francisco  who was selling fruit for his father   Look  my basket is as heavy as when I left home and look at  em yourself  they really are fine fresh fish to  day and yet  because that revengeful booby told how I took him in yesterday  not one of yonder crowd would buy them  and all the time they really are fresh to  day   So they are  said Franscisco   but you said so yesterday  when they were not  and he that was duped then  is not ready to believe you to  day  How does he know that you deserve it better   He might have looked at the fish  repeated Piedro   they are fresh to  day  I am sure he need not have been afraid   Ay  said Francisco   but as my father said to you once  the scalded dog fears cold water    Il cane scottato dell  acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda  Here their conversation was interrupted by the same English lad  who smiled as he came up to Francisco  and taking up a fine pine  apple  he said  in a mixture of bad Italian and English  I need not look at the other side of this  you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks  Name your price  I know you have but one  and that an honest one  and as to the rest  I am able and willing to pay for what I buy  that is to say  my master is  which comes to the same thing  I wish your fruit could make him well  and it would be worth its weight in gold to me  at least  We must have some of your grapes for him   Is he not well  inquired Francisco   We must  then  pick out the best for him  at the same time singling out a tempting bunch   I hope he will like these  but if you could some day come as far as Resina ( it is a village but a few miles out of town  where we have our vineyard ) you could there choose for yourself  and pluck them fresh from the vines for your poor master   Bless you  my good boy  I should take you for an Englishman  by your way of dealing  I  ll come to your village  Only write me down the name  for your Italian names slip through my head  I  ll come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off  and all the time we stay in Naples ( may it not be so long as I fear it will ) with my master  s leave  which he never refuses me to anything that  s proper  I  ll deal with you for all our fruit  as sure as my name  s Arthur  and with none else  with my good will  I wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesty  indeed I do  concluded the Englishman  looking full at Piedro  who took up his unsold basket of fish  looking somewhat silly  and gloomily walked off  Arthur  the English servant  was as good as his word  He dealt constantly with Francisco  and proved an excellent customer  buying from him during the whole season as much fruit as his master wanted  His master  who was an Englishman of distinction  was invited to take up his residence  during his stay in Italy  at the Count de F  s villa  which was in the environs of Naples  an easy walk from Resina  Francisco had the pleasure of seeing his father  s vineyard often full of generous visitors  and Arthur  who had circulated the anecdote of the bruised melon  was  he said   proud to think that some of this was his doing  and that an Englishman never forgot a good turn  be it from a countryman or foreigner   My dear boy  said Francisco  s father to him  whilst Arthur was in the vineyard helping to tend the vines   I am to thank you and your honesty  it seems  for our having our hands so full of business this season  It is fair you should have a share of our profits   So I have  father  enough and enough  when I see you and mother going on so well  What can I want more   Oh  my brave boy  we know you are a grateful  good son  but I have been your age myself  you have companions  you have little expenses of your own  Here  this vine  this fig  tree  and a melon a week next summer shall be yours  With these make a fine figure amongst the little Neapolitan merchants  and all I wish is that you may prosper as well  and by the same honest means  in managing for yourself  as you have done managing for me   Thank you  father  and if I prosper at all  it shall be by those means  and no other  or I should not be worthy to be called your son  Piedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a summer  s work as did Francisco the honest  No extraordinary events happened  no singular instance of bad or good luck occurred  but he felt  as persons usually do  the natural consequences of his own actions  He pursued his scheme of imposing  as far as he could  upon every person he dealt with  and the consequence was  that at last nobody would deal with him   It is easy to outwit one person  but impossible to outwit all the world  said a man  who knew the world at least as well as either Piedro or his father   The Duke de Rochefoucault  On peut etre puls fin qu  un autre  mais pas plus fin que tous les autres  Piedro  s father  amongst others  had reason to complain  He saw his own customers fall off from him  and was told  whenever he went into the market  that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him  One day  when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour  in consequence of these reproaches  and of his not having found customers for his goods  he espied his SMART son Piedro at a little merchant  s fruit  board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness   Where  glutton  do you find money to pay for these dainties  exclaimed his father  coming close up to him  with angry gestures  Piedro  s mouth was much too full to make an immediate reply  nor did his father wait for any  but darting his hand into the youth  s pocket  pulled forth a handful of silver   The money  father  said Piedro   that I got for the fish yesterday  and that I meant to give you to  day  before you went out   Then I  ll make you remember it against another time  sirrah  said his father   I  ll teach you to fill your stomach with my money  Am I to lose my customers by your tricks  and then find you here eating my all  You are a rogue  and everybody has found you out to be a rogue  and the worst of rogues I find you  who scruples not to cheat his own father  Saying these words  with great vehemence he seized hold of Piedro  and in the very midst of the little fruit  market gave him a severe beating  This beating did the boy no good  it was vengeance not punishment  Piedro saw that his father was in a passion  and knew that he was beaten because he was found out to be a rogue  rather than for being one  He recollected perfectly that his father once said to him   Let everyone take care of his own grapes  Indeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had been educated to think that he might cheat every customer he could in the way of trade  should be afterwards scrupulously honest in his conduct towards the father whose proverbs encouraged his childhood in cunning  Piedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing  but his mind was not in the least amended  On the contrary  he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation  All the little merchants were spectators of this scene  and heard his father  s words   You ARE a rogue  and the worst of rogues  who scruples not to cheat his own father  These words were long remembered  and long did Piedro feel their effects  He once flattered himself that  when his trade of selling fish failed him  he could readily engage in some other  but he now found  to his mortification  that what Francisco  s father said proved true   In all trades the best fortune to set up with is a good character  Not one of the little Neapolitan merchants would either enter into partnership with him  give him credit  or even trade with him for ready money   If you would cheat your own father  to be sure you will cheat us  was continually said to him by these prudent little people  Piedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and abroad  His father  when he found that his son  s smartness was no longer useful in making bargains  shoved him out of his way whenever he met him  All the food or clothes that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly  and with such expressions as these   Take that  but it is too good for you  You must eat this  now  instead of gourds and figs  and be thankful you have even this  Piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily  He expected that all his old tricks  and especially what his father had said of him in the market  place  would be soon forgotten  but month passed after month  and still these things were fresh in the memory of all who had known them  It is not easy to get rid of a bad character  A very great rogue  was once heard to say  that he would  with all his heart  give ten thousand pounds for a good character  because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by it   Chartres  Something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation  and when he saw the numerous advantages which Francisco  s good character procured  Such had been Piedro  s wretched education  that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its pernicious effects  He was sorry his knavery had been detected  but he still thought it clever to cheat  and was secretly persuaded that  if he had cheated successfully  he should have been happy   But I know I am not happy now  said he to himself one morning  as he sat alone disconsolate by the sea  shore  dressed in tattered garments  weak and hungry  with an empty basket beside him  His fishing  rod  which he held between his knees  bent over the dry sands instead of into the water  for he was not thinking of what he was about  his arms were folded  his head hung down  and his ragged hat was slouched over his face  He was a melancholy spectacle  Francisco  as he was coming from his father  s vineyard with a large dish of purple and white grapes upon his head  and a basket of melons and figs hanging upon his arm  chanced to see Piedro seated in this melancholy posture  Touched with compassion  Francisco approached him softly  his footsteps were not heard upon the sands  and Piedro did not perceive that anyone was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand  he then started  and  looking up  saw a bunch of grapes  which Francisco was holding over his head   Eat them  you  ll find them very good  I hope  said Francisco  with a benevolent smile   They are excellent  most excellent  and I am much obliged to you  Francisco  said Piedro   I was very hungry  and that  s what I am now  without anybody  s caring anything about it  I am not the favourite I was with my father  but I know it is all my own fault   Well  but cheer up  said Francisco   my father always says   One who knows he has been in fault  and acknowledges it  will scarcely be in fault again  Yes  take as many figs as you will  continued he  and held his basket closer to Piedro  who  as he saw  cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs   But  said Piedro  after he had taken several   shall not I get you into a scrape by taking so many  Won  t your father be apt to miss them   Do you think I would give them to you if they were not my own  said Francisco  with a sudden glance of indignation   Well  don  t be angry that I asked the question  it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that I asked it   It would not be easy for anybody to do that  I hope  said Francisco  rather proudly   And to me less than anybody  replied Piedro  in an insinuating tone   _I  _ that am so much obliged to you   A bunch of grapes  and a few figs  are no mighty obligation  said Francisco  smiling   I wish I could do more for you  You seem  indeed  to have been very unhappy of late  We never see you in the markets as we used to do   No  ever since my father beat me  and called me rogue before all the children there  I have never been able to show my face without being gibed at by one or t  other  If you would but take me along with you amongst them  and only just SEEM my friend  for a day or two  or so  it would quite set me up again  for they all like you   I would rather BE than seem your friend  if I could  said Francisco   Ay  to be sure  that would be still better  said Piedro  observing that Francisco  as he uttered his last sentence  was separating the grapes and other fruits into two equal divisions   To be sure I would rather you would BE than SEEM a friend to me  but I thought that was too much to ask at first  though I have a notion  notwithstanding I have been so UNLUCKY lately  I have a notion you would have no reason to repent of it  You would find me no bad hand  if you were to try  and take me into partnership   Partnership  interrupted Francisco  drawing back alarmed   I had no thoughts of that   But won  t you  can  t you  said Piedro  in a supplicating tone   CAN  T you have thoughts of it  You  d find me a very active partner  Franscisco still drew back  and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground  He was embarrassed  for he pitied Piedro  and he scarcely knew how to point out to him that something more is necessary in a partner in trade besides activity  and that is honesty   Can  t you  repeated Piedro  thinking that he hesitated from merely mercenary motives   You shall have what share of the profits you please   I was not thinking of the profits  said Francisco   but without meaning to be ill  natured to you  Piedro  I must say that I cannot enter into any partnership with you at present  but I will do what  perhaps  you will like as well  said he  taking half the fruit out of his basket   you are heartily welcome to this  try and sell it in the children  s fruit market  I  ll go on before you  and speak to those I am acquainted with  and tell them you are going to set up a new character  and that you hope to make it a good one   Hey  shall I  Thank you for ever  dear Francisco  cried Piedro  seizing his plentiful gift of fruit   Say what you please for me   But don  t make me say anything that is not true  said Francisco  pausing   No  to be sure not  said Piedro   I DO mean to give no room for scandal  If I could get them to trust me as they do you  I should be happy indeed   That is what you may do  if you please  said Francisco   Adieu  I wish you well with all my heart  but I must leave you now  or I shall be too late for the market  CHAPTER II  Chi va piano va sano  e anche lontano  Fair and softly goes far in a day  Piedro had now an opportunity of establishing a good character  When he went into the market with his grapes and figs  he found that he was not shunned or taunted as usual  All seemed disposed to believe in his intended reformation  and to give him a fair trial  These favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence of Francisco  s benevolent representations  He told them that he thought Piedro had suffered enough to cure him of his tricks  and that it would be cruelty in them  because he might once have been in fault  to banish him by their reproaches from amongst them  and thus to prevent him from the means of gaining his livelihood honestly  Piedro made a good beginning  and gave what several of the younger customers thought excellent bargains  His grapes and figs were quickly sold  and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh supply  and thus he went on for some time  conducting himself with scrupulous honesty  so that he acquired some credit among his companions  They no longer watched him with suspicious eyes  They trusted to his measures and weights  and they counted less carefully the change which they received from him  The satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners was at first delightful to Piedro  but in proportion to his credit  his opportunities of defrauding increased  and these became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist  His old manner of thinking recurred   I make but a few shillings a day  and this is but slow work  said he to himself   What signifies my good character  if I make so little by it  Light gains  and frequent  make a heavy purse   was one of Francisco  s proverbs  But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time into his account  He set his invention to work  and he did not want for ingenuity  to devise means of cheating without running the risk of detection  He observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums  and of burnt almonds   Poco e spesso empie il l  orsetto  With the money he had earned by two months  trading in fruit he laid in a large stock of what appeared to these little merchants a stock of almonds and sugar  plums  and he painted in capital gold coloured letters upon his board   Sweetest  largest  most admirable sugar  plums of all colours ever sold in Naples  to be had here  and in gratitude to his numerous customers  Piedro adds to these   Burnt almonds gratis  This advertisement attracted the attention of all who could read  and many who could not read heard it repeated with delight  Crowds of children surrounded Piedro  s board of promise  and they all went away the first day amply satisfied  Each had a full measure of coloured sugar  plums at the usual price  and along with these a burnt almond gratis  The burnt almond had such an effect upon the public judgment  that it was universally allowed that the sugar  plums were  as the advertisement set forth  the largest  sweetest  most admirable ever sold in Naples  though all the time they were  in no respect  better than any other sugar  plums  It was generally reported that Piedro gave full measure  fuller than any other board in the city  He measured the sugar  plums in a little cubical tin box  and this  it was affirmed  he heaped up to the top  and pressed down before he poured out the contents into the open hands of his approving customers  This belief  and Piedro  s popularity  continued longer even than he had expected  and  as he thought his sugar  plums had secured their reputation with the GENEROUS PUBLIC  he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds gratis  One day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by  whistling as he went along  and swinging a carpenter  s rule in his hand   Ha  what have we here  cried he  stopping to read what was written on Piedro  s board   This promises rarely  Old as I am  and tall of my age  which makes the matter worse  I am still as fond of sugar  plums as my little sister  who is five years younger than I  Come  Signor  fill me quick  for I  m in haste to taste them  two measures of the sweetest  largest  most admirable sugar  plums in Naples  one measure for myself and one for my little Rosetta   You  ll pay for yourself and your sister  then  said Piedro   for no credit is given here   No credit do I ask  replied the lively boy   when I told you I loved sugar  plums  did I tell you I loved them  or even my sister  so well as to run in debt for them  Here  s for myself  and here  s for my sister  s share  said he  laying down his money   and now for the burnt almonds gratis  my good fellow   They are all out  I have been out of burnt almonds this great while  said Piedro   Then why are they in your advertisement here  said Carlo   I have not had time to scratch them out of the board   What  not when you have  by your own account  been out of them a great while  I did not know it required so much time to blot out a few words  let us try  and as he spoke  Carlo  for that was the name of Piedro  s new customer  pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket  and drew a broad score across the line on the board which promised burnt almonds gratis   You are most impatient  said Piedro   I shall have a fresh stock of almonds to  morrow   Why must the board tell a lie to  day   It would ruin me to alter it  said Piedro   A lie may ruin you  but I could scarcely think the truth could   You have no right to meddle with me or my board  said Piedro  put off his guard  and out of his usual soft voice of civility  by this last observation   My character  and that of my board  are too firmly established now for any chance customer like you to injure   I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else  said Carlo  I wish  moreover  you may not injure yourself  Do as you please with your board  but give me my sugar  plums  for I have some right to meddle with those  having paid for them   Hold out your hand  then   No  put them in here  if you please  put my sister  s  at least  in here  she likes to have them in this box  I bought some for her in it yesterday  and she  ll think they  ll taste the better out of the same box  But how is this  your measure does not fill my box nearly  you give us very few sugar  plums for our money   I give you full measure  as I give to everybody   The measure should be an inch cube  I know  said Carlo   that  s what all the little merchants have agreed to  you know   True  said Piedro   so it is   And so it is  I must allow  said Carlo  measuring the outside of it with the carpenter  s rule which he held in his hand   An inch every way  and yet by my eye  and I have no bad one  being used to measuring carpenter  s work for my father  by my eye I should think this would have held more sugar  plums   The eye often deceives us  said Piedro   There  s nothing like measuring  you find   There  s nothing like measuring  I find  indeed  replied Carlo  as he looked closely at the end of his rule  which  since he spoke last  he had put into the cube to take its depth in the inside   This is not as deep by a quarter of an inch  Signor Piedro  measured within as it is measured without  Piedro changed colour terribly  and seizing hold of the tin box  endeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately  Carlo held his prize fast  and lifting it above his head  he ran into the midst of the square where the little market was held  exclaiming   A discovery  a discovery  that concerns all who love sugar  plums  A discovery  a discovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest  and most admirable sugar  plums ever sold in Naples  The crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he spoke   We have bought  and  We have bought of those sugar  plums  cried several little voices at once   if you mean Piedro  s   The same  continued Carlo  he who  out of gratitude to his numerous customers  gives  or promises to give  burnt almonds gratis   Excellent they were  cried several voices   We all know Piedro well  but what  s your discovery   My discovery is  said Carlo   that you  none of you  know Piedro  Look you here  look at this box  this is his measure  it has a false bottom  it holds only three  quarters as much as it ought to do  and his numerous customers have all been cheated of one  quarter of every measure of the admirable sugar  plums they have bought from him   Think twice of a good bargain  says the proverb   So we have been finely duped  indeed  cried some of the bystanders  looking at one another with a mortified air   Full of courtesy  full of craft    So this is the meaning of his burnt almonds gratis  cried others  all joined in an uproar of indignation  except one  who  as he stood behind the rest  expressed in his countenance silent surprise and sorrow   Chi et FA pi caress che non vole  O ingannato t  ha  o inganuar et vole   Is this Piedro a relation of yours  said Carlo  going up to this silent person   I am sorry  if he be  that I have published his disgrace  for I would not hurt YOU  You don  t sell sugar  plums as he does  I  m sure  for my little sister Rosetta has often bought from you  Can this Piedro be a friend of yours   I wished to have been his friend  but I see I can  t  said Francisco   He is a neighbour of ours  and I pitied him  but since he is at his old tricks again  there  s an end of the matter  I have reason to be obliged to you  for I was nearly taken in  He has behaved so well for some time past  that I intended this very evening to have gone to him  and to have told him that I was willing to do for him what he has long begged of me to do  to enter into partnership with him   Francisco  Francisco  your measure  lend us your measure  exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding round him   You have a measure for sugar  plums  and we have all agreed to refer to that  and to see how much we have been cheated before we go to break Piedro  s bench and declare him bankrupt   the punishment for all knaves   This word comes from two Italian words  bunco rotto  broken bench  Bankers and merchants used formerly to count their money  and write their bills of exchange upon benches in the streets  and when a merchant or banker lost his credit  and was unable to pay his debts  his bench was broken  They pressed on to Francisco  s board  obtained his measure  found that it held something more than a quarter above the quantity that could be contained in Piedro  s  The cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous  They hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles  and  forming themselves into a formidable phalanx  they proceeded towards Piedro  s well known yellow lettered board  exclaiming  as they went along   Common cause  common cause  The little Neapolitan merchants will have no knaves amongst them  Break his bench  break his bench  He is a bankrupt in honesty  Piedro saw the mob  heard the indignant clamour  and  terrified at the approach of numbers  he fled with the utmost precipitation  having scarcely time to pack up half his sugar  plums  There was a prodigious number  more than would have filled many honest measures  scattered upon the ground and trampled under foot by the crowd  Piedro  s bench was broken  and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his treacherous painted board  It was  after being much disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for Piedro  hung up in a conspicuous part of the market  place  and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon one of its corners  Piedro could never more show his face in this market  and all hopes of friendship  all hopes of partnership with Francisco  were for ever at an end  If rogues would calculate  they would cease to be rogues  for they would certainly discover that it is most for their interest to be honest  setting aside the pleasure of being esteemed and beloved  of having a safe conscience  with perfect freedom from all the various embarrassments and terror to which knaves are subject  Is it not clear that our crafty hero would have gained rather more by a partnership with Francisco  and by a fair character  than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent dealing in comfits  When the mob had dispersed  after satisfying themselves with executing summary justice upon Piedro  s bench and board  Francisco found a carpenter  s rule lying upon the ground near Piedro  s broken bench  which he recollected to have seen in the hands of Carlo  He examined it carefully  and he found Carlo  s name written upon it  and the name of the street where he lived  and though it was considerably out of his way  he set out immediately to restore the rule  which was a very handsome one  to its rightful owner  After a hot walk through several streets  he overtook Carlo  who had just reached the door of his own house  Carlo was particularly obliged to him  he said  for restoring this rule to him  as it was a present from the master of a vessel  who employed his father to do carpenter  s work for him   One should not praise one  s self  they say  continued Carlo   but I long so much to gain your good opinion  that I must tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored  It was given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a whole pleasure  boat myself  You may guess I should have been sorry enough to have lost it  Thank you for its being once more in my careless hands  and tell me  I beg  whenever I can do you any service  By  the  by  I can make up for you a fruit stall  I  ll do it to  morrow  and it shall be the admiration of the market  Is there anything else you could think of for me   Why  yes  said Francisco   since you are so good  natured  perhaps you  d be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that I see upon your rule  I have a great curiosity to know their use   That I  ll explain to you with pleasure  as far as I know them myself  but when I  m at fault  my father  who is cleverer than I am  and understands trigonometry  can help us out   Trigonometry  repeated Francisco  not a little alarmed at the high sounding word   that  s what I certainly shall never understand   Oh  never fear  replied Carlo  laughing   I looked just as you do now   I felt just as you do now  all in a fright and a puzzle  when I first heard of angles and sines  and cosines  and arcs and centres  and complements and tangents   Oh mercy  mercy  interrupted Francisco  whilst Carlo laughed  with a benevolent sense of superiority   Why  said Carlo   you  ll find all these things are nothing when you are used to them  But I cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the sun  Besides  it will not be the work of a day  I promise you  but come and see us at your leisure hours  and we  ll study it together  I have a great notion we shall become friends  and  to begin  step in with me now  said Carlo   and eat a little macaroni with us  I know it is ready by this time  Besides  you  ll see my father  and he  ll show you plenty of rules and compasses  as you like such things  and then I  ll go home with you in the cool of the evening  and you shall show me your melons and vines  and teach me  in time  something of gardening  Oh  I see we must be good friends  just made for each other  so come in  no ceremony  Carlo was not mistaken in his predictions  he and Francisco became very good friends  spent all their leisure hours together  either in Carlo  s workshop or in Francisco  s vineyard  and they mutually improved each other  Francisco  before he saw his friend  s rule  knew but just enough of arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he sold in the market  but with Carlo  s assistance  and the ambition to understand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule  he set to work in earnest  and in due time  satisfied both himself and his master   Who knows but these things that I am learning now may be of some use to me before I die  said Francisco  as he was sitting one morning with his tutor  the carpenter   To be sure it will  said the carpenter  putting down his compasses  with which he was drawing a circle  Arithmetic is a most useful  and I was going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations  and a little trigonometry does no harm  In short  my maxim is  that no knowledge comes amiss  for a man  s head is of as much use to him as his hands  and even more so   A word to the wise will always suffice   Besides  to say nothing of making a fortune  is not there a great pleasure in being something of a scholar  and being able to pass one  s time with one  s book  and one  s compasses and pencil  Safe companions these for young and old  No one gets into mischief that has pleasant things to think of and to do when alone  and I know  for my part  that trigonometry is  Here the carpenter  just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry  was interrupted by the sudden entrance of his little daughter Rosetta  all in tears  a very unusual spectacle  for  taking the year round  she shed fewer tears than any child of her age in Naples   Why  my dear good humoured little Rosetta  what has happened  Why these large tears  said her brother Carlo  and he went up to her  and wiped them from her cheeks   And these that are going over the bridge of the nose so fast  I must stop these tears  too  said Carlo  Rosetta  at this speech  burst out laughing  and said that she did not know till then that she had any bridge on her nose   And were these shells the cause of the tears  said her brother  looking at a heap of shells  which she held before her in her frock   Yes  partly  said Rosetta   It was partly my own fault  but not all  You know I went out to the carpenter  s yard  near the arsenal  where all the children are picking up chips and sticks so busily  and I was as busy as any of them  because I wanted to fill my basket soon  and then I thought I should sell my basketful directly in the little wood  market  As soon as I had filled my basket  and made up my faggot ( which was not done  brother  till I was almost baked by the sun  for I was forced to wait by the carpenters for the bits of wood to make up my faggot ) I say  when it was all ready  and my basket full  I left it altogether in the yard   That was not wise to leave it  said Carlo   But I only left it for a few minutes  brother  and I could not think anybody would be so dishonest as to take it whilst I was away  I only just ran to tell a boy  who had picked up all these beautiful shells upon the sea  shore  and who wanted to sell them  that I should be glad to buy them from him  if he would only be so good as to keep them for me  for an hour or so  till I had carried my wood to market  and till I had sold it  and so had money to pay him for the shells   Your heart was set mightily on these shells  Rosetta   Yes  for I thought you and Francisco  brother  would like to have them for your nice grotto that you are making at Resina  That was the reason I was in such a hurry to get them  The boy who had them to sell was very good  natured  he poured them into my lap  and said I had such an honest face he would trust me  and that as he was in a great hurry  he could not wait an hour whilst I sold my wood  but that he was sure I would pay him in the evening  and he told me that he would call here this evening for the money  But now what shall I do  Carlo  I shall have no money to give him  I must give back his shells  and that  s a great pity   But how happened it that you did not sell your wood   Oh  I forgot  did not I tell you that  When I went for my basket  do you know it was empty  quite empty  not a chip left  Some dishonest person had carried it all off  Had not I reason to cry now  Carlo   I  ll go this minute into the wood  market  and see if I can find your faggot  Won  t that be better than crying  said her brother   Should you know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them   Yes  one of them  I am sure  I should know again  said Rosetta   It had a notch at one end of it  where one of the carpenters cut it off from another piece of wood for me   And is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be seen  said Francisco   Yes  it is in the yard  but I cannot bring it to you  for it is very heavy   We can go to it  said Francisco   and I hope we shall recover your basketful  Carlo and his friend went with Rosetta immediately to the yard  near the arsenal  saw the notched piece of wood  and then proceeded to the little wood  market  and searched every heap that lay before the little factors  but no notched bit was to be found  and Rosetta declared that she did not see one stick that looked at all like any of hers  On their part  her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them to her  and exclaimed   That they were incapable of taking what did not belong to them  that of all persons they should never have thought of taking anything from the good natured little Rosetta  who was always ready to give to others  and to help them in making up their loads  Despairing of discovering the thief  Francisco and Carlo left the market  As they were returning home  they were met by the English servant Arthur  who asked Francisco where he had been  and where he was going  As soon as he heard of Rosetta  s lost faggot  and of the bit of wood  notched at one end  of which Rosetta drew the shape with a piece of chalk  which her brother had lent her  Arthur exclaimed   I have seen such a bit of wood as this within this quarter of an hour  but I cannot recollect where  Stay  this was at the baker  s  I think  where I went for some rolls for my master  It was lying beside his oven  To the baker  s they all went as fast as possible  and they got there but just in time  The baker had in his hand the bit of wood with which he was that instant going to feed his oven   Stop  good Mr  Baker  cried Rosetta  who ran into the baker  s shop first  and as he heard  Stop  stop  re  echoed by many voices  the baker stopped  and turning to Francisco  Carlo and Arthur  begged  with a countenance of some surprise  to know why they had desired him to stop  The case was easily explained  and the baker told them that he did not buy any wood in the little market that morning  that this faggot he had purchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about Francisco  s height  whom he met near the yard of the arsenal   This is my bit of wood  I am sure  I know it by this notch  said Rosetta   Well  said the baker   if you will stay here a few minutes  you will probably see the lad who sold it to me  He desired to be paid in bread  and my bread was not quite baked when he was here  I bid him call again in an hour  and I fancy he will be pretty punctual  for he looked desperately hungry  The baker had scarcely finished speaking when Francisco  who was standing watching at the door  exclaimed   Here comes Piedro  I hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood  Mr  Baker   He is the boy  though  replied the baker  and Piedro  who now entered the shop  started at the sight of Carlo and Francisco  whom he had never seen since the day of disgrace in the fruit  market   Your servant  Signor Piedro  said Carlo   I have the honour to tell you that this piece of wood  and all that you took out of the basket  which you found in the yard of the arsenal  belongs to my sister   Yes  indeed  cried Rosetta  Piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied Rosetta  s basket  and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion of a child like Rosetta  who might be baffled and frightened out of her story  boldly denied the charge  and defied any one to prove him guilty   He has a right to be heard in his own defence  said Arthur  with the cool justice of an Englishman  and he stopped the angry Carlo  s arm  who was going up to the culprit with all the Italian vehemence of oratory and gesture  Arthur went on to say something in bad Italian about the excellence of an English trial by jury  which Carlo was too much enraged to hear  but to which Francisco paid attention  and turning to Piedro  he asked him if he was willing to be judged by twelve of his equals   With all my heart  said Piedro  still maintaining an unmoved countenance  and they returned immediately to the little wood  market  On their way  they had passed through the fruit  market  and crowds of those who were well acquainted with Piedro  s former transactions followed  to hear the event of the present trial  Arthur could not  especially as he spoke wretched Italian  make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an English trial by jury  They preferred their own summary mode of proceeding  Francisco  in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence  was chosen with unanimous shouts for the judge  but he declined the office  and another was appointed  He was raised upon a bench  and the guilty but insolent looking Piedro  and the ingenuous  modest Rosetta stood before him  She made her complaint in a very artless manner  and Piedro  with ingenuity  which in a better cause would have deserved admiration  spoke volubly and craftily in his own defence  But all that he could say could not alter facts  The judge compared the notched bit of wood found at the baker  s with a piece from which it was cut  which he went to see in the yard of the arsenal  It was found to fit exactly  The judge then found it impossible to restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators  The prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market  and the moment sentence was pronounced  Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market  place  Thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread  We shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades he next attempted  He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he was not known  but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage  He then took to the waters from the sulphurous springs  and served them about to foreigners  but one day  as he was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door  he slipped his foot  and broke his glasses  They had been borrowed from an old woman  who hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade  Piedro knew that it was the custom to pay  of course  for all that was broken  but this he was not inclined to do  He had a few shillings in his pocket  and thought that it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her right  and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he did his good name  macaroni  The shillings were soon gone  We shall now for the present leave Piedro to his follies and his fate  or  to speak more properly  to his follies and their inevitable consequences  Francisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new friends  without neglecting his own or his father  s business  He contrived  during the course of autumn and winter  to make himself a tolerable arithmetician  Carlo  s father could draw plans in architecture neatly  and pleased with the eagerness Francisco showed to receive instruction  he willingly put a pencil and compasses into his hand  and taught him all he knew himself  Francisco had great perseverance  and  by repeated trials  he at length succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his master lent him  His copies  in time  surpassed the originals  and Carlo exclaimed  with astonishment   Why  Francisco  what an astonishing GENIUS you have for drawing  Absolutely you draw plans better than my father   As to genius  said Francisco  honestly   I have none  All that I have done has been done by hard labour  I don  t know how other people do things  but I am sure that I never have been able to get anything done well but by patience  Don  t you remember  Carlo  how you and even Rosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my awkward  clumsy hands   Because  said Carlo  laughing again at the recollection   you held your pencil so drolly  and when you were to cut it  you cut it just as if you were using a pruning  knife to your vines  but now it is your turn to laugh  for you surpass us all  And the times are changed since I set about to explain this rule of mine to you   Ay  that rule  said Francisco  how much I owe to it  Some great people  when they lose any of their fine things  cause the crier to promise a reward of so much money to anyone who shall find and restore their trinket  How richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning this rule  Francisco  s modesty and gratitude  as they were perfectly sincere  attached his friends to him most powerfully  but there was one person who regretted our hero  s frequent absences from his vineyard at Resina  Not Francisco  s father  for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his business  and as to the hours spent in Naples  he had so much confidence in Francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his getting into bad company  When his son had once said to him   I spend my time at such a place  and in such and such a manner  he was as well convinced of its being so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day  But it was Arthur who complained of Francisco  s absence   I see  because I am an Englishman  said he   you don  t value my friendship  and yet that is the very reason you ought to value it  no friends so good as the English  be it spoken without offence to your Italian friend  for whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and down here in Resina  without a soul that I like to speak to  for you are the only Italian I ever liked   You shall like another  I promise you  said Francisco   You must come with me to Carlo  s  and see how I spend my evenings  then complain of me  if you can  It was the utmost stretch of Arthur  s complaisance to pay this visit  but  in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper  he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous Carlo and the playful Rosetta  They showed him Francisco  s drawings with enthusiastic eagerness  and Arthur  though no great judge of drawing  was in astonishment  and frequently repeated   I know a gentleman who visits my master who would like these things  I wish I might have them to show him   Take them  then  said Carlo   I wish all Naples could see them  provided they might be liked half as well as I like them  Arthur carried off the drawings  and one day  when his master was better than usual  and when he was at leisure  eating a dessert of Francisco  s grapes  he entered respectfully  with his little portfolio under his arm  and begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the gardener  s son  whose grapes he was eating  Though not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic Carlo  this gentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings  considering how short a time Francisco had applied himself to this art  and what slight instructions he had received  Arthur was desired to summon the young artist  Francisco  s honest  open manner  joined to the proofs he had given of his abilities  and the character Arthur gave him for strict honesty  and constant kindness to his parents  interested Mr  Lee  the name of this English gentleman  much in his favour  Mr  Lee was at this time in treaty with an Italian painter  whom he wished to engage to copy for him exactly some of the cornices  mouldings  tablets  and antique ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient city of Herculaneum    We must give those of our young English readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city of Herculaneum  some idea of it  None can be ignorant that near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of Vesuvius  that  from time to time  there happen violent eruptions from this mountain  that is to say  flames and immense clouds of smoke issue from different openings  mouths  or CRATERS  as they are called  but more especially from the summit of the mountain  which is distinguished by the name of THE crater  A rumbling  and afterwards a roaring noise is heard within  and prodigious quantities of stones and minerals burnt into masses ( scoriae ) are thrown out of the crater  sometimes to a great distance  The hot ashes from Mount Vesuvius have often been seen upon the roofs of the houses of Naples  from which it is six miles distant  Streams of lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an eruption  destroying everything in their way  and overwhelm the houses and vineyards which are in the neighbourhood  About OO years ago  during the reign of the Roman Emperor Titus  there happened a terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius  and a large city called Herculaneum  which was situated at about four miles  distance from the volcano  was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it  filled up the streets  and quickly covered over the tops of the houses  so that the whole was no more visible  It remained for many years buried  The lava which covered it became in time fit for vegetation  plants grew there  a new soil was formed  and a new town called Portici was built over this place where Herculaneum formerly stood  The little village of Resina is also situated near the spot  About fifty years ago  in a poor man  s garden at Resina  a hole in a well about thirty feet below the surface of the earth was observed  Some persons had the curiosity to enter into this hole  and  after creeping underground for some time  they came to the foundations of houses  The peasants  inhabitants of the village  who had probably never heard of Herculaneum  were somewhat surprised at their discovery  About the same time  in a pit in the town of Portici  a similar passage underground was discovered  and  by orders of the King of Naples  workmen were employed to dig away the earth  and clear the passage  They found  at length  the entrance into the town  which  during the reign of Titus  was buried under lava  It was about eighty  eight Neapolitan palms ( a palm contains near nine inches ) below the top of the pit  The workmen  as they cleared the passages  marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning  lest they should lose themselves  The streets branched out in many directions  and  lying across them  the workmen often found large pieces of timber  beams  and rafters  some broken in the fall  others entire  These beams and rafters are burned quite black like charcoal  except those that were found in moist places  which have more the colour of rotten wood  and which are like a soft paste  into which you might run your hand  The walls of the houses slant  some one way  some another  and some are upright  Several magnificent buildings of brick  faced with marble of different colours  are partly seen  where the workmen have cleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted  Columns of red and white marble  and flights of steps  are seen in different places  and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and pictures have been dug  Foreigners who visit Naples are very curious to see this subterraneous city  and are desirous to carry with them into their own country some proofs of their having examined this wonderful place   Philosophical Transactions  vol  ix  p  0  CHAPTER III  Tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca cosa  What great events from trivial causes spring  Signor Camillo  the artist employed by Mr  Lee to copy some of the antique ornaments in Herculaneum  was a liberal minded man  perfectly free from that mean jealousy which would repress the efforts of rising genius   Here is a lad scarcely fifteen  a poor gardener  s son  who  with merely the instructions he could obtain from a common carpenter  has learned to draw these plans and elevations  which you see are tolerably neat  What an advantage your instruction would be to him  said Mr  Lee  as he introduced Francisco to Signor Camillo   I am interested in this lad from what I have learned of his good conduct  I hear he is strictly honest  and one of the best of sons  Let us do something for him  If you will give him some knowledge of your art  I will  as far as money can recompense you for your loss of time  pay whatever you may think reasonable for his instruction  Signor Camillo made no difficulties  he was pleased with his pupil  s appearance  and every day he liked him better and better  In the room where they worked together there were some large books of drawings and plates  which Francisco saw now and then opened by his master  and which he had a great desire to look over  but when he was left in the room by himself he never touched them  because he had not permission  Signor Camillo  the first day he came into this room with his pupil  said to him   Here are many valuable books and drawings  young man  I trust  from the character I have heard of you  that they will be perfectly safe here  Some weeks after Francisco had been with the painter  they had occasion to look for the front of a temple in one of these large books   What  don  t you know in which book to look for it  Francisco  cried his master  with some impatience   Is it possible that you have been here so long with these books  and that you cannot find the print I mean  Had you half the taste I gave you credit for  you would have singled it out from all the rest  and have it fixed in your memory   But  signor  I never saw it  said Francisco  respectfully   or  perhaps  I should have preferred it   That you never saw it  young man  is the very thing of which I complain  Is a taste for the arts to be learned  think you  by looking at the cover of a book like this  Is it possible that you never thought of opening it   Often and often  cried Francisco   have I longed to open it  but I thought it was forbidden me  and however great my curiosity in your absence  I have never touched them  I hoped indeed  that the time would come when you would have the goodness to show them to me   And so the time is come  excellent young man  cried Camillo   much as I love taste  I love integrity more  I am now sure of your having the one  and let me see whether you have  as I believe you have  the other  Sit you down here beside me  and we will look over these books together  The attention with which his young pupil examined everything  and the pleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these excellent prints  sufficiently convinced his judicious master that it was not from the want of curiosity or taste that he had never opened these tempting volumes  His confidence in Francisco was much increased by this circumstance  slight as it may appear  One day  Signor Camillo came behind Francisco  as he was drawing with much intentness  and tapping him upon the shoulder  he said to him   Put up your pencils and follow me  I can depend upon your integrity  I have pledged myself for it  Bring your note  book with you  and follow me  I will this day show you something that will entertain you at least as much as my large book of prints  Follow me  Francisco followed  till they came to the pit near the entrance of Herculaneum   I have obtained leave for you to accompany me  said his master   and you know  I suppose  that this is not a permission granted to everyone  Paintings of great value  besides ornaments of gold and silver  antique bracelets  rings  etc  are from time to time found amongst these ruins  and therefore it is necessary that no person should be admitted whose honesty cannot be depended upon  Thus  even Francisco  s talents could not have advanced him in the world  unless they had been united to integrity  He was much delighted and astonished by the new scene that was now opened to his view  and as  day after day  he accompanied his master to this subterraneous city  he had leisure for observation  He was employed  as soon as he had gratified his curiosity  in drawing  There are niches in the walls in several places  from which pictures have been dug  and these niches are often adorned with elegant masques  figures and animals  which have been left by the ignorant or careless workmen  and which are going fast to destruction  Signor Camillo  who was copying these for his English employer  had a mind to try his pupil  s skill  and  pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque figures  he desired him to try if he could make any hand of it  Francisco made several trials  and at last finished such an excellent copy  that his enthusiastic and generous master  with warm encomiums  carried it immediately to his patron  and he had the pleasure to receive from Mr  Lee a purse containing five guineas  as a reward and encouragement for his pupil  Francisco had no sooner received this money  than he hurried to his father and mother  s cottage  His mother  some months before this time  had taken a small dairy farm  and her son had once heard her express a wish that she was but rich enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled cow  which belonged to a farmer in the neighbourhood   Here  my dear mother  cried Francisco  pouring the guineas into her lap   and here  continued he  emptying a bag which contained about as much more  in small Italian coins  the profits of trade  money he had fairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little Neapolitan merchants   this is all yours  dearest mother  and I hope it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow  Nay  you must not refuse me   I have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening  and I  ll produce my best bunches of grapes  and my father  perhaps  will give us a melon  for I  ve had no time for melons this season  and I  ll step to Naples and invite  may I  mother  my good friends  dear Carlo and your favourite little Rosetta  and my old drawing master  and my friend Arthur  and we  ll sup with you at your dairy  The happy mother thanked her son  and the father assured him that neither melon nor pine  apple should be spared  to make a supper worthy of his friends  The brindled cow was bought  and Arthur and Carlo and Rosetta most joyfully accepted their invitation  The carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day with one of his employers  and he could not accompany his children  It was a delicious evening  they left Naples just as the sea  breeze  after the heats of the day  was most refreshingly felt  The walk to Resina  the vineyard  the dairy  and most of all  the brindled cow  were praised by Carlo and Rosetta  with all the Italian superlatives which signify   Most beautiful  most delightful  most charming  Whilst the English Arthur  with as warm a heart  was more temperate in his praise  declaring that this was  the most like an English summer  s evening of any he had ever felt since he came to Italy  and that  moreover  the cream was almost as good as what he had been used to drink in Cheshire  The company  who were all pleased with each other  and with the gardener  s good fruit  which he produced in great abundance  did not think of separating till late  It was a bright moonlight night  and Carlo asked his friend if he would walk with them part of the way to Naples   Yes  all the way most willingly  cried Francisco   that I may have the pleasure of giving to your father  with my own hands  this fine bunch of grapes  that I have reserved for him out of my own share   Add this fine pine  apple for my share  then  said his father   and a pleasant walk to you  my young friends  They proceeded gaily along  and when they reached Naples  as they passed through the square where the little merchants held their market  Francisco pointed to the spot where he found Carlo  s rule  He never missed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness to him   That rule  said he   has been the cause of all my present happiness  and I thank you for   Oh  never mind thanking him now  interrupted Rosetta   but look yonder  and tell me what all those people are about  She pointed to a group of men  women and children  who were assembled under a piazza  listening in various attitudes of attention to a man  who was standing upon a flight of steps speaking in a loud voice  and with much action  to the people who surrounded him  Francisco  Carlo and Rosetta joined his audience  The moon shone full upon his countenance  which was very expressive and which varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose history he was telling  according to all the changes of their fortune  This man was one of those who are called Improvisatori  persons who  in Italian towns  go about reciting verses or telling stories  which they are supposed to invent as they go on speaking  Some of these people speak with great fluency  and collect crowds round them in the public streets  When an Improvisatore sees the attention of his audience fixed  and when he comes to some very interesting part of his narrative  he dexterously drops his hat upon the ground  and pauses till his auditors have paid tribute to his eloquence  When he thinks the hat sufficiently full  he takes it up again  and proceeds with his story  The hat was dropped just as Francisco and his two friends came under the piazza  The orator had finished one story  and was going to commence another  He fixed his eyes upon Francisco  then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta  and after a moment  s consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young English readers may  perhaps  know by the name of  Cornaro  or the Grateful Turk  Francisco was deeply interested in this narrative  and when the hat was dropped  he eagerly threw in his contribution  At the end of the story  when the speaker  s voice stopped  there was a momentary silence  which was broken by the orator himself  who exclaimed  as he took up the hat which lay at his feet   My friends  here is some mistake  this is not my hat  it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my story  Pray  gentlemen  find my hat amongst you  it was a remarkably good one  a present from a nobleman for an epigram I made  I would not lose my hat for twice its value  It has my name written withinside of it  Dominicho  Improvisatore  Pray  gentlemen  examine your hats  Everybody present examined their hats  and showed them to Dominicho  but his was not amongst them  No one had left the company  the piazza was cleared  and searched in vain   The hat has vanished by magic  said Dominicho   Yes  and by the same magic a statue moves  cried Carlo  pointing to a figure standing in a niche  which had hitherto escaped observation  The face was so much in the shade  that Carlo did not at first perceive that the statue was Piedro  Piedro  when he saw himself discovered  burst into a loud laugh  and throwing down Dominicho  s hat  which he held in his hand behind him  cried   A pretty set of novices  Most excellent players at hide  and  seek you would make  Whether Piedro really meant to have carried off the poor man  s hat  or whether he was  as he said  merely in jest  we leave it to those who know his general character to decide  Carlo shook his head   Still at your old tricks  Piedro  said he   Remember the old proverb  No fox so cunning but he comes to the furrier  s at last    Tutte le volpi si trovano in pellicera   I defy the furrier and you  too  replied Piedro  taking up his own ragged hat   I have no need to steal hats  I can afford to buy better than you  ll have upon your head  Francisco  a word with you  if you have done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so attentively   And what would you say to me  said Francisco  following him a few steps   Do not detain me long  because my friends will wait for me   If they are friends  they can wait  said Piedro   You need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now  I can tell you  for I am  as I always told you I should be  the richest man of the two   Rich  you rich  cried Francisco   Well  then  it was impossible you could mean to trick that poor man out of his good hat   Impossible  said Piedro  Francisco did not consider that those who have habits of pilfering continue to practise them often  when the poverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases   Impossible  You stare when I tell you I am rich  but the thing is so  Moreover  I am well with my father at home  I have friends in Naples  and I call myself Piedro the Lucky  Look you here  said he  producing an old gold coin   This does not smell of fish  does it  My father is no longer a fisherman  nor I either  Neither do I sell sugar  plums to children  nor do I slave myself in a vineyard  like some folks  but fortune  when I least expected it  has stood my friend  I have many pieces of gold like this  Digging in my father  s garden  it was my luck to come to an old Roman vessel full of gold  I have this day agreed for a house in Naples for my father  We shall live  whilst we can afford it  like great folks  you will see  and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of my old friends  the little Neapolitan merchants  who will change their note when they see my change of fortune  What say you to all this  Francisco the Honest   That I wish you joy of your prosperity  and hope you may enjoy it long and well   Well  no doubt of that  Everyone who has it enjoys it WELL  He always dances well to whom fortune pipes    Assai ben balla a chi fortuna suona   Yes  no longer pipe  no longer dance  replied Francisco  and here they parted  for Piedro walked away abruptly  much mortified to perceive that his prosperity did not excite much envy  or command any additional respect from Francisco   I would rather  said Francisco  when he returned to Carlo and Rosetta  who waited for him under the portico  where he left them  I would rather have such good friends as you  Carlo and Arthur  and some more I could name  and  besides that  have a clear conscience  and work honestly for my bread  than be as lucky as Piedro  Do you know he has found a treasure  he says  in his father  s garden  a vase full of gold  He showed me one of the gold pieces   Much good may they do him  I hope he came honestly by them  said Carlo   but ever since the affair of the double measure  I suspect double  dealing always from him  It is not our affair  however  Let him make himself happy his way  and we ours   He that would live in peace and rest  Must hear  and see  and say the best    Odi  vedi  taci  se vuoi viver in pace  All Piedro  s neighbours did not follow this peaceable maxim  for when he and his father began to circulate the story of the treasure found in the garden  the village of Resina did not give them implicit faith  People nodded and whispered  and shrugged their shoulders  then crossed themselves  and declared that they would not  for all the riches of Naples  change places with either Piedro or his father  Regardless  or pretending to be regardless  of these suspicions  Piedro and his father persisted in their assertions  The fishing  nets were sold  and everything in their cottage was disposed of  they left Resina  went to live at Naples  and  after a few weeks  the matter began to be almost forgotten in the village  The old gardener  Francisco  s father  was one of those who endeavoured to THINK THE BEST  and all that he said upon the subject was  that he would not exchange Francisco the Honest for Piedro the Lucky  that one can  t judge of the day till one sees the evening as well as the morning    La vita il fine  e di loda la sera   Compute the morn and evening of their day  Pope  Not to leave our readers longer in suspense  we must inform them that the peasants of Resina were right in their suspicions  Piedro had never found any treasure in his father  s garden  but he came by his gold in the following manner  After he was banished from the little wood  market for stealing Rosetta  s basketful of wood  after he had cheated the poor woman  who let glasses out to hire  out of the value of the glasses which he broke  and  in short  after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him  he roamed about the streets of Naples  reckless of what became of him  He found the truth of the proverb   that credit lost is like a Venice glass broken  it can  t be mended again  The few shillings which he had in his pocket supplied him with food for a few days  At last he was glad to be employed by one of the peasants who came to Naples to load their asses with manure out of the streets  They often follow very early in the morning  or during the night  time  the trace of carriages that are gone  or that are returning from the opera  and Piedro was one night at this work  when the horses of a nobleman  s carriage took fright at the sudden blaze of some fireworks  The carriage was overturned near him  a lady was taken out of it  and was hurried by her attendants into a shop  where she stayed till her carriage was set to rights  She was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of anything  but after some time  she perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross  which she had worn that night at the opera  She was uncertain where she had dropped it  the shop  the carriage  the street  were searched for it in vain  Piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage  seized upon it  and carried it off  Ignorant as he was of the full value of what he had stolen  he knew not how to satisfy himself as to this point  without trusting someone with the secret  After some hesitation  he determined to apply to a Jew  who  as it was whispered  was ready to buy everything that was offered to him for sale  without making any TROUBLESOME inquiries  It was late  he waited till the streets were cleared  and then knocked softly at the back door of the Jew  s house  The person who opened the door for Piedro was his own father  Piedro started back  but his father had fast hold of him   What brings you here  said the father  in a low voice  a voice which expressed fear and rage mixed   Only to ask my way  my shortest way  stammered Piedro   No equivocations  Tell me what brings you here at this time of the night  I WILL know  Piedro  who felt himself in his father  s grasp  and who knew that his father would certainly search him  to find out what he had brought to sell  thought it most prudent to produce the diamond cross  His father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp  which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood   You would have been duped  if you had gone to sell this to the Jew  It is well it has fallen into my hands  How came you by it  Piedro answered that he had found it in the street   Go your ways home  then  said his father   it is safe with me  Concern yourself no more about it  Piedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty  and he now thought proper to vary in his account of the manner in which he found the cross  He now confessed that it had dropped from the dress of a lady  whose carriage was overturned as she was coming home from the opera  and he concluded by saying that  if his father took his prize from him without giving him his share of the profits  he would go directly to the shop where the lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage  and that he would give notice of his having found the cross  Piedro  s father saw that his SMART son  though scarcely sixteen years of age  was a match for him in villainy  He promised him that he should have half of whatever the Jew would give for the diamonds  and Piedro insisted upon being present at the transaction  We do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of iniquity  It is sufficient to say that the Jew  who was a man old in all the arts of villainy  contrived to cheat both his associates  and obtained the diamond cross for less than half its value  The matter was managed so that the transaction remained undiscovered  The lady who lost the cross  after making fruitless inquiries  gave up the search  and Piedro and his father rejoiced in the success of their manoeuvres  It is said  that  Ill gotten wealth is quickly spent   and so it proved in this instance  Both father and son lived a riotous life as long as their money lasted  and it did not last many months  What his bad education began  bad company finished  and Piedro  s mind was completely ruined by the associates with whom he became connected during what he called his PROSPERITY  When his money was at an end  these unprincipled friends began to look cold upon him  and at last plainly told him  If you mean to LIVE WITH US  you must LIVE AS WE DO  They lived by robbery   Vien presto consumato l  ingiustamente acquistato  Piedro  though familiarized to the idea of fraud  was shocked at the thought of becoming a robber by profession  How difficult it is to stop in the career of vice  Whether Piedro had power to stop  or whether he was hurried on by his associates  we shall  for the present  leave in doubt  CHAPTER IV We turn with pleasure from Piedro the Cunning to Francisco the Honest  Francisco continued the happy and useful course of his life  By his unremitting perseverance  he improved himself rapidly under the instructions of his master and friend  Signor Camillo  his friend  we say  for the fair and open character of Francisco won  or rather earned  the friendship of this benevolent artist  The English gentleman seemed to take a pride in our hero  s success and good conduct  He was not one of those patrons who think that they have done enough when they have given five guineas  His servant Arthur always considered every generous action of his master  s as his own  and was particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed towards Francisco  As for Carlo and the little Rosetta  they were the companions of all the pleasant walks which Francisco used to take in the cool of the evening  after he had been shut up all day at his work  And the old carpenter  delighted with the gratitude of his pupil  frequently repeated  that he was proud to have given the first instructions to such a GENIUS  and that he had always prophesied Francisco would be a GREAT man   And a good man  papa  said Rosetta   for though he has grown so great  and though he goes into palaces now  to say nothing of that place underground  where he has leave to go  yet  notwithstanding all this  he never forgets my brother Carlo and you   That  s the way to have good friends  said the carpenter   And I like his way  he does more than he says  Facts are masculine  and words are feminine    I fatti sono maschii  le parole femmine  These goods friends seemed to make Francisco happier than Piedro could be made by his stolen diamonds  One morning  Francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an ancient temple  amongst the ruins of Herculaneum  He had just reached the pit  and the men were about to let him down with cords  in the usual manner  when his attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding woman  s voice  He looked  and saw at some paces distant this female fury  who stood guarding the windlass of a well  to which  with threatening gestures and most voluble menaces  she forbade all access  The peasants  men  women and children  who had come with their pitchers to draw water at this well  were held at bay by the enraged female  Not one dared to be the first to advance  whilst she grasped with one hand the handle of the windlass  and  with the other tanned muscular arm extended  governed the populace  bidding them remember that she was padrona  or mistress of the well  They retired  in hopes of finding a more gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood  and the fury  when they were out of sight  divided the long black hair which hung over her face  and  turning to one of the spectators  appealed to them in a sober voice  and asked if she was not right in what she had done   I  that am padrona of the well  said she  addressing herself to Francisco  who  with great attention  was contemplating her with the eye of a painter  I  that am padrona of the well  must in times of scarcity do strict justice  and preserve for ourselves alone the water of our well  There is scarcely enough even for ourselves  I have been obliged to make my husband lengthen the ropes every day for this week past  If things go on at this rate  there will soon be not one drop of water left in my well   Nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood  added one of the workmen  who was standing by  and he mentioned several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased  and a miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water  Francisco was struck by these remarks  They brought to his recollection similar facts  which he had often heard his father mention in his childhood  as having been observed previous to the last eruption of Mount Vesuvius   He had also heard from his father  in his childhood  that it is better to trust to prudence than to fortune  and therefore  though the peasants and workmen  to whom he mentioned his fears  laughed  and said   That as the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many years  they would trust to it and St  Januarius one day longer  yet Francisco immediately gave up all thoughts of spending this day amidst the ruins of Herculaneum  After having inquired sufficiently  after having seen several wells  in which the water had evidently decreased  and after having seen the mill  wheels that were standing still for want of their usual supply  he hastened home to his father and mother  reported what he had heard and seen  and begged of them to remove  and to take what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous spot where they now resided   Phil  Trans  vol  ix  Some of the inhabitants of Resina  whom he questioned  declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground  and a peasant and his son  who had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard  a little above the village  related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth  close to them  and that they had  at the same time  heard a noise like the going off of a pistol    These facts are mentioned in Sir William Hamilton  s account of an eruption of Mount Vesuvius  See Phil  Trans    first part  The villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations  yet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon  or such the security in their own good fortune  that few of them would believe that there could be any necessity for removing  We  ll see what will happen to  morrow  we shall be safe here one day longer  said they  Francisco  s father and mother  more prudent than the generality of their neighbours  went to the house of a relation  at some miles  distance from Vesuvius  and carried with them all their effects  In the meantime  Francisco went to the villa where his English friends resided  The villa was in a most dangerous situation  near Terre del Greco  a town that stands at the foot of Mount Vesuvius  He related all the facts that he had heard to Arthur  who  not having been  like the inhabitants of Resina  familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity of a burning mountain  and habituated to trust in St  Januarius  was sufficiently alarmed by Francisco  s representations  He ran to his master  s apartment  and communicated all that he had just heard  The Count de Flora and his lady  who were at this time in the house  ridiculed the fears of Arthur  and could not be prevailed upon to remove even as far as Naples  The lady was intent upon preparations for her birthday  which was to be celebrated in a few days with great magnificence at their villa  and she observed that it would be a pity to return to town before that day  and they had everything arranged for the festival  The prudent Englishman had not the gallantry to appear to be convinced by these arguments  and he left the place of danger  He left it not too soon  for the next morning exhibited a scene  a scene which we shall not attempt to describe  We refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful eruption of Mount Vesuvius  published by Sir W  Hamilton in the  Philosophical Transactions  It is sufficient here to say that  in the space of about five hours  the wretched inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain  The villa of Count de Flora  with some others  which were at a little distance from the town  escaped  but they were absolutely surrounded by the lava  The count and countess were obliged to fly from their house with the utmost precipitation in the night  time  and they had not time to remove any of their furniture  their plate  clothes  or jewels  A few days after the eruption  the surface of the lava became so cool that people could walk upon it  though several feet beneath the surface it was still exceedingly hot  Numbers of those who had been forced from their houses now returned to the ruins to try to save whatever they could  But these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been pillaged by robbers  who  in these moments of general confusion  enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow  creatures   Has the count abandoned his villa  and is there no one to take care of his plate and furniture  The house will certainly be ransacked before morning  said the old carpenter to Francisco  who was at his house giving him an account of their flight  Francisco immediately went to the count  s house in warn him of his danger  The first person he saw was Arthur  who  with a face of terror  said to him   Do you know what has happened  It is all over with Resina   All over with Resina  What  has there been a fresh eruption  Has the lava reached Resina   No  but it will inevitably be blown up  There  said Arthur  pointing to a thin figure of an Italian  who stood pale and trembling  and looking up to heaven as he crossed himself repeatedly   There  said Arthur   is a man who has left a parcel of his cursed rockets and fireworks  with I don  t know how much gunpowder  in the count  s house  from which we have just fled  The wind blows that way  One spark of fire  and the whole is blown up  Francisco waited not to hear more  but instantly  without explaining his intentions to anyone  set out for the count  s villa  and  with a bucket of water in his hand  crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed  when  reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left  he plunged them into the water  and returned with them in safety over the lava  yet warm under his feet  What was the surprise and joy of the poor firework  maker when he saw Francisco return from this dangerous expedition  He could scarcely believe his eyes  when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe  The count  who had given up the hopes of saving his palace  was in admiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity  which properly saved not only his villa  but the whole village of Resina  from destruction  These fireworks had been prepared for the celebration of the countess  birthday  and were forgotten in the hurry of the night on which the inhabitants fled from Torre del Greco   Brave young man  said the count to Francisco   I thank you  and shall not limit my gratitude to thanks  You tell me that there is danger of my villa being pillaged by robbers  It is from this moment your interest  as well as mine  to prevent their depredations  for ( trust to my liberality ) a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be yours   Bravo  bravissimo  exclaimed one  who started from a recessed window in the hall where all this passed   Bravo  bravissimo  Francisco thought he knew the voice and the countenance of this man  who exclaimed with so much enthusiasm  He remembered to have seen him before  but when  or where  he could not recollect  As soon as the count left the hall  the stranger came up to Francisco   Is it possible  said he   that you don  t know me  It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your eyes   Tears from my eyes  repeated Francisco  smiling   I have shed but few tears  I have had but few misfortunes in my life  The stranger answered him by two extempore Italian lines  which conveyed nearly the same idea that has been so well expressed by an English poet   To each their sufferings  all are men Condemn  d alike to groan  The feeling for another  s woes  Th  unfeeling for his own   I know you now perfectly well  cried Francisco   you are the Improvisatore who  one fine moonlight night last summer  told us the story of Cornaro the Turk   The same  said the Improvisatore   the same  though in a better dress  which I should not have thought would have made so much difference in your eyes  though it makes all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid vulgar  My genius has broken through the clouds of misfortune of late  A few happy impromptu verses I made on the Count de Flora  s fall from his horse attracted attention  The count patronizes me  I am here now to learn the fate of an ode I have just composed for his lady  s birthday  My ode was to have been set to music  and to have been performed at his villa near Torre del Greco  if these troubles had not intervened  Now that the mountain is quiet again  people will return to their senses  I expect to be munificently rewarded  But  perhaps  I detain you  Go  I shall not forget to celebrate the heroic action you have performed this day  I still amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the evenings  and I shall sound your praises through Naples in a poem I mean to recite on the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius  Adieu  The Improvisatore was as good as his word  That evening  with more than his usual enthusiasm  he recited his verses to a great crowd of people in one of the public squares  Amongst the crowd were several to whom the name of Francisco was well known  and by whom he was well beloved  These were his young companions  who remembered him as a fruit  seller amongst the little merchants  They rejoiced to hear his praises  and repeated the lines with shouts of applause   Let us pass  What is all this disturbance in the streets  said a man  pushing his way through the crowd  A lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on hearing the name of Francisco  which the people were repeating with so much enthusiasm   Ha  I have found at last a story that interests you more than that of Cornaro the Turk  cried the Improvisatore  looking in the face of the youth  who had stopped so suddenly   You are the young man who  last summer  had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat  Promise me you won  t touch it now  said he  throwing down the hat at his feet   or you hear not one word I have to say  Not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the Count de Flora  near Torre del Greco  this morning  by Signor Francisco   SIGNOR Francisco  repeated the lad with disdain   Well  let us hear what you have to tell of him  added he   Your hat is very safe  I promise you  I shall not touch it  What of SIGNOR Francisco   SIGNOR Francisco I may  without impropriety  call him  said the Improvisatore   for he is likely to become rich enough to command the title from those who might not otherwise respect his merit   Likely to become rich  how  said the lad  whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be Piedro   How  pray  is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor   The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture  plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at Torre del Greco  Francisco is gone down hither now with some of the count  s domestics to protect the valuable goods against those villainous plunderers  who robbed their fellow  creatures of what even the flames of Vesuvius would spare   Come  we have had enough of this stuff  cried the man whose arm Piedro held   Come away  and he hurried forwards  This man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed such indignation  He was one of those with whom Piedro got acquainted during the time that he was living extravagantly upon the money he gained by the sale of the stolen diamond cross  That robbery was not discovered  and his success  as he called it  hardened him in guilt  He was both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company with whom his ill gotten wealth connected him  He did not consider that bad company leads to the gallows    La mala compagnia e quella che mena uomini a la forca  The universal confusion which followed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was to these villains a time of rejoicing  No sooner did Piedro  s companion hear of the rich furniture  plate  etc  which the imprudent orator had described as belonging to the Count de Flora  s villa  than he longed to make himself master of the whole   It is a pity  said Piedro   that the count has sent Francisco  with his servants down to guard it   And who is this Francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe   A boy  a young lad only  of about my own age  but I know him to be sturdily honest  The servants we might corrupt  but even the old proverb of  Angle with a silver hook   won  t hold good with him   Pescar col hamo d  argento   And if he cannot be won by fair means  he must be conquered by foul  said the desperate villain   but if we offer him rather more than the count has already promised for his share of the booty  of course he will consult at once his safety and his interest   No  said Piedro   that is not his nature  I know him from a child  and we had better think of some other house for to  night  s business   None other  none but this  cried his companion  with an oath   My mind is determined upon this  and you must obey your leader  recollect the fate of him who failed me yesterday  The person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers who had been assassinated by his companions for hesitating to commit some crime suggested by their leader  No tyranny is so dreadful as that which is exercised by villains over their young accomplices  who become their slaves  Piedro  who was of a cowardly nature  trembled at the threatening countenance of his captain  and promised submission  In the course of the morning  inquiries were made secretly amongst the count  s servants  and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa that night along with Francisco  were bribed to second the views of this gang of thieves  It was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be let into the house  that Francisco should be tied hand and foot  whilst they carried off their booty   He is a stubborn chap  though so young  I understand  said the captain of the robbers to his men   but we carry poniards  and know how to use them  Piedro  you look pale  You don  t require to be reminded of what I said to you when we were alone just now  Piedro  s voice failed  and some of his comrades observed that he was young and new to the business  The captain  who  from being his pretended friend during his wealthy days  had of late become his tyrant  cast a stern look at Piedro  and bid him be sure to be at the old Jew  s  which was the place of meeting  in the dusk of the evening  After saying this he departed  Piedro  when he was alone  tried to collect his thoughts  all his thoughts were full of horror   Where am I  said he to himself   what am I about  Did I understand rightly what he said about poniards  Francisco  oh  Francisco  Excellent  kind  generous Francisco  Yes  I recollect your look when you held the bunch of grapes to my lips  as I sat by the sea  shore deserted by all the world  and now  what friends have I  Robbers and  The word MURDERERS he could not utter  He again recollected what had been said about poniards  and the longer his mind fixed upon the words  and the look that accompanied them  the more he was shocked  He could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his accomplices to murder Francisco  if he should make any resistance  Piedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he could apply for advice or assistance  His wretched father died some weeks before this time  in a fit of intoxication  Piedro walked up and down the street  scarcely capable of thinking  much less of coming to any rational resolution  The hours passed away  the shadows of the houses lengthened under his footsteps  the evening came on  and when it grew dusk  after hesitating in great agony of mind for some time  his fear of the robbers  vengeance prevailed over every other feeling  and he went at the appointed hour to the place of meeting  The place of meeting was at the house of that Jew to whom he  several months before  sold the diamond cross  That cross which he thought himself so lucky to have stolen  and to have disposed of undetected  was  in fact  the cause of his being in his present dreadful situation  It was at the Jew  s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers  to whom he was now become an absolute slave   Oh  that I dared to disobey  said he to himself  with a deep sigh  as he knocked softly at the back door of the Jew  s house  The back door opened into a narrow  unfrequented street  and some small rooms at this side of the house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired to have their business kept secret  These rooms were separated by a dark passage from the rest of the house  and numbers of people came to the shop in the front of the house  which looked into a creditable street  without knowing anything more  from the ostensible appearance of the shop  than that it was a kind of pawnbroker  s  where old clothes  old iron  and all sorts of refuse goods  might be disposed of conveniently  At the moment Piedro knocked at the back door  the front shop was full of customers  and the Jew  s boy  whose office it was to attend to these signals  let Piedro in  told him that none of his comrades were yet come  and left him in a room by himself  He was pale and trembling  and felt a cold dew spread over him  He had a leaden image of Saint Januarius tied round his neck  which  in the midst of his wickedness  he superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm  and on this he kept his eyes stupidly fixed  as he sat alone in this gloomy place  He listened from time to time  but he heard no noise at the side of the house where he was  His accomplices did not arrive  and  in a sort of impatient terror  the attendant upon an evil conscience  he flung open the door of his cell  and groped his way through the passage which he knew led to the public shop  He longed to hear some noise  and to mix with the living  The Jew  when Piedro entered the shop  was bargaining with a poor  thin  looking man about some gunpowder   I don  t deny that it has been wet  said the man   but since it was in the bucket of water  it has been carefully dried  I tell you the simple truth  that so soon after the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius  the people of Naples will not relish fireworks  My poor little rockets  and even my Catherine  wheels  will have no effect  I am glad to part with all I have in this line of business  A few days ago I had fine things in readiness for the Countess de Flora  s birthday  which was to have been celebrated at the count  s villa   Why do you fix your eyes on me  friend  What is your discourse to me  said Piedro  who imagined that the man fixed his eyes upon him as he mentioned the name of the count  s villa   I did not know that I fixed my eyes upon you  I was thinking of my fireworks  said the poor man  simply   But now that I do look at you and hear your voice  I recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you before   When  where  said Piedro   A great while ago  no wonder you have forgotten me  said the man   but I can recall the night to your recollection  You were in the street with me the night I let off that unlucky rocket  which frightened the horses  and was the cause of overturning a lady  s coach  Don  t you remember the circumstance   I have a confused recollection of some such thing  said Piedro  in great embarrassment  and he looked suspiciously at this man  in doubt whether he was cunning  and wanted to sound him  or whether he was so simple as he appeared   You did not  perhaps  hear  then  continued the man   that there was a great search made  after the overturn  for a fine diamond cross  belonging to the lady in the carriage  That lady  though I did not know it till lately  was the Countess de Flora   I know nothing of the matter  interrupted Piedro  in great agitation  His confusion was so marked  that the firework  maker could not avoid taking notice of it  and a silence of some moments ensued  The Jew  more practised in dissimulation than Piedro  endeavoured to turn the man  s attention back to his rockets and his gunpowder  agreed to take the gunpowder  paid for it in haste  and was  though apparently unconcerned  eager to get rid of him  But this was not so easily done  The man  s curiosity was excited  and his suspicions of Piedro were increased every moment by all the dark changes of his countenance  Piedro  overpowered with the sense of guilt  surprised at the unexpected mention of the diamond cross  and of the Count de Flora  s villa  stood like one convicted  and seemed fixed to the spot  without power of motion   I want to look at the old cambric that you said you had  that would do for making  that you could let me have cheap for artificial flowers  said the firework  maker to the Jew  and as he spoke  his eye from time to time looked towards Piedro  Piedro felt for the leaden image of the saint  which he wore round his neck  The string which held it cracked  and broke with the pull he gave it  This slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious mind more than all the rest  He imagined that at this moment his fate was decided  that Saint Januarius deserted him  and that he was undone  He precipitately followed the firework  man the instant he left the shop  and seizing hold of his arm  whispered   I must speak to you   Speak  then  said the man  astonished   Not here  this way  said he  drawing him towards the dark passage   what I have to say must not be overheard  You are going to the Count de Flora  s  are not you   I am  said the man  He was going there to speak to the countess about some artificial flowers  but Piedro thought he was going to speak to her about the diamond cross   You are going to give information against me  Nay  hear me  I confess that I purloined that diamond cross  but I can do the count a great service  upon condition that he pardons me  His villa is to be attacked this night by four well armed men  They will set out five hours hence  I am compelled  under the threat of assassination  to accompany them  but I shall do no more  I throw myself upon the count  s mercy  Hasten to him  we have no time to lose  The poor man  who heard this confession  escaped from Piedro the moment he loosed his arm  With all possible expedition he ran to the count  s palace in Naples  and related to him all that had been said by Piedro  Some of the count  s servants  on whom he could most depend  were at a distant part of the city attending their mistress  but the English gentleman offered the services of his man Arthur  Arthur no sooner heard the business  and understood that Francisco was in danger  than he armed himself without saying one word  saddled his English horse  and was ready to depart before anyone else had finished their exclamations and conjectures   But we are not to set out yet  said the servant   it is but four miles to Torre del Greco  the sbirri ( officers of justice ) are summoned  they are to go with us  we must wait for them  They waited  much against Arthur  s inclination  a considerable time for these sbirri  At length they set out  and just as they reached the villa  the flash of the pistol was seen from one of the apartments in the house  The robbers were there  This pistol was snapped by their captain at poor Francisco  who had bravely asserted that he would  as long as he had life  defend the property committed to his care  The pistol missed fire  for it was charged with some of the damaged powder which the Jew had bought that evening from the firework maker  and which he had sold as excellent immediately afterwards to his favourite customers  the robbers who met at his house  Arthur  as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece  pressed forward through all the apartments  followed by the count  s servants and the officers of justice  At the sudden appearance of so many armed men  the robbers stood dismayed  Arthur eagerly shook Francisco  s hand  congratulating him upon his safety  and did not perceive  till he had given him several rough friendly shakes  that his arm was wounded  and that he was pale with the loss of blood   It is not much  only a slight wound  said Francisco   one that I should have escaped  if I had been upon my guard  but the sight of a face that I little expected to see in such company took from me all presence of mind  and one of the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm  whilst I stood in stupid astonishment   Oh  take me to prison  take me to prison  I am weary of life  I am a wretch not fit to live  cried Piedro  holding his hands to be tied by the sbirri  The next morning Piedro was conveyed to prison  and as he passed through the streets of Naples he was met by several of those who had known him when he was a child   Ay  said they  as he went by   his father encouraged him in cheating when he was BUT A CHILD  and see what he is come to  now he is a man  He was ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement  His captain and his accomplices were sent to the galleys  and the Jew was banished from Naples  And now  having got these villains out of the way  let us return to honest Francisco  His wound was soon healed  Arthur was no bad surgeon  for he let his patient get well as fast as he pleased  and Carlo and Rosetta nursed him with so much kindness  that he was almost sorry to find himself perfectly recovered   Now that you are able to go out  said Francisco  s father to him   you must come and look at my new house  my dear son   Your new house  father   Yes  son  and a charming one it is  and a handsome piece of land near it  all at a safe distance  too  from Mount Vesuvius  and can you guess how I came by it  it was given to me for having a good son   Yes  cried Carlo   the inhabitants of Resina  and several who had property near Terre del Greco  and whose houses and lives were saved by your intrepidity in carrying the materials for the fireworks and the gunpowder out of this dangerous place  went in a body to the duke  and requested that he would mention your name and these facts to the king  who  amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius  has been pleased to say that he gives this house and garden to your father  because you have saved the property and lives of many of his subjects  The value of a handsome portion of furniture  plate  etc  in the Count de Flora  s villa  was  according to the count  s promise  given to him  and this money he divided between his own family and that of the good carpenter who first put a pencil into his hands  Arthur would not accept of any present from him  To Mr  Lee  the English gentleman  he offered one of his own drawings  a fruit  piece   I like this very well  said Arthur  as he examined the drawing   but I should like this melon better if it was a little bruised  It is now three years ago since I was going to buy that bruised melon from you  you showed me your honest nature then  though you were but a boy  and I have found you the same ever since  A good beginning makes a good ending  an honest boy will make an honest man  and honesty is the best policy  as you have proved to all who wanted the proof  I hope   Yes  added Francisco  s father   I think it is pretty plain that Piedro the Cunning has not managed quite so well as Francisco the Honest  TARLTON  Delightful task  to rear the tender thought  To teach the young idea how to shoot  To pour the fresh instruction o  er the mind  To breathe th  enlivening spirit  and to fix The generous purpose in the glowing breast  THOMSON  Young Hardy was educated by Mr  Freeman  a very excellent master  at one of our rural Sunday schools  He was honest  obedient  active and good  natured  hence he was esteemed by his master  and being beloved by all his companions who were good  he did not desire to be loved by the bad  nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle  mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him  His friend Loveit  on the contrary  wished to be universally liked  and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school  and so he was  He usually went by the name of POOR LOVEIT  and everybody pitied him when he got into disgrace  which he frequently did  for though he had a good disposition  he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely because he could never have the courage to say  NO  because he was afraid to offend the ill  natured  and could not bear to be laughed at by fools  One fine autumn evening  all the boys were permitted to go out to play in a pleasant green meadow near the school  Loveit and another boy  called Tarlton  began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock  and a large party stood by to look on  for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock in the school  and this was a trial of skill between them  When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty  the game became very interesting  The arms of the combatants tired that they could scarcely wield the battledores  The shuttlecock began to waver in the air  now it almost touched the ground  and now  to the astonishment of the spectators  mounted again high over their heads  yet the strokes became feebler and feebler  and  Now  Loveit   Now  Tarlton  resounded on all sides  For another minute the victory was doubtful  but at length the setting sun  shining full in Loveit  s face  so dazzled his eyes that he could no longer see the shuttlecock  and it fell at his feet  After the first shout for Tarlton  s triumph was over  everybody exclaimed   Poor Loveit  he  s the best natured fellow in the world  What a pity that he did not stand with his back to the sun   Now  I dare you all to play another game with me  cried Tarlton  vauntingly  and as he spoke  he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his force  with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane  which went close beside the field   Hey  day  said Tarlton   what shall we do now  The boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane  and it was upon their promise not to break this command  that they were allowed to play in the adjoining field  No other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped  They stood on the top of the bank  peeping over the hedge   I see it yonder  said Tarlton   I wish somebody would get it  One could get over the gate at the bottom of the field  and be back again in half a minute  added he  looking at Loveit   But you know we must not go into the lane  said Loveit  hesitatingly   Pugh  said Tarlton   why  now  what harm could it do   I don  t know  said Loveit  drumming upon his battledore   but   You don  t know  man  why  then  what are you afraid of  I ask you  Loveit coloured  went on drumming  and again  in a lower voice  said  HE DIDN  T KNOW  But upon Tarlton  s repeating  in a more insolent tone   I ask you  man  what you  re afraid of  he suddenly left off drumming  and looking round  said   he was not afraid of anything that he knew of   Yes  but you are  said Hardy  coming forward   Am I  said Loveit   of what  pray  am I afraid   Of doing wrong   Afraid OF DOING WRONG  repeated Tarlton  mimicking him  so that he made everybody laugh   Now  hadn  t you better say afraid of being flogged   No  said Hardy  coolly  after the laugh had somewhat subsided   I am as little afraid of being flogged as you are  Tarlton  but I meant   No matter what you meant  why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings  nobody thought of asking YOU to stir a step for us  but we asked Loveit  because he  s the best fellow in the world   And for that very reason you should not ask him  because  you know he can  t refuse you anything   Indeed  though  cried Loveit  piqued   THERE you  re mistaken  for I could refuse if I chose it  Hardy smiled  and Loveit  half afraid of his contempt  and half afraid of Tarlton  s ridicule  stood doubtful  and again had recourse to his battledore  which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger   Look at him  now do look at him  cried Tarlton   did you ever in your life see anybody look so silly  Hardy has him quite under his thumb  he  s so mortally afraid of Parson Prig  that he dare not  for the soul of him  turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose  look how he squints   I don  t squint  said Loveit  looking up   and nobody has me under his thumb  and what Hardy said was only for fear I should get in disgrace  he  s the best friend I have  Loveit spoke this with more than usual spirit  for both his heart and his pride were touched   Come along  then  said Hardy  taking him by the arm in an affectionate manner  and he was just going  when Tarlton called after him   Ay  go along with its best friend  and take care it does not get into a scrape   good  bye  Little Panado   Whom do they call Little Panado  said Loveit  turning his head hastily back   Never mind  said Hardy   what does it signify   No  said Loveit   to be sure it does not signify  but one does not like to be called Little Panado  besides  added he  after going a few steps farther   they  ll all think it so ill  natured  I had better go back  and just tell them that I  m very sorry I can  t get their shuttlecock  do come back with me   No  said Hardy   I can  t go back  and you  d better not   But  I assure you  I won  t stay a minute  wait for me  added Loveit  and he slunk back again to prove that he was not Little Panado  Once returned  the rest followed  of course  for to support his character of good  nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions  and to show his spirit  leapt over the gate  amidst the acclamations of the little mob  he was quickly out of sight   Here  cried he  returning in about five minutes  quite out of breath   I  ve got the shuttlecock  and I  ll tell you what I  ve seen  cried he  panting for breath   What  cried everybody  eagerly   Why  just at the turn of the corner  at the end of the lane  panting   Well  said Tarlton  impatiently   do go on   Let me just take breath first   Pugh  never mind your breath   Well  then  just at the turn of the corner  at the end of the lane  as I was looking about for the shuttlecock  I heard a great rustling somewhere near me  and so I looked where it could come from  and I saw  in a nice little garden  on the opposite side of the way  a boy  about as big as Tarlton  sitting in a great tree  shaking the branches  so I called to the boy  to beg one  but he said he could not give me one  for that they were his grandfather  s  and just at that minute  from behind a gooseberry bush  up popped the uncle  the grandfather poked his head out of the window  so I ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though I heard him bawling after me all the way   And let him bawl  cried Tarlton   he shan  t bawl for nothing  I  m determined we  ll have some of his fine large rosy apples before I sleep to  night  At this speech a general silence ensued  everybody kept their eyes fixed upon Tarlton  except Loveit  who looked down  apprehensive that he should be drawn on much farther than he intended   Oh  indeed  said he to himself   as Hardy told me  I had better not have come back  Regardless of this confusion  Tarlton continued   But before I say any more  I hope we have no spies amongst us  If there is any one of you afraid to be flogged  let him march off this instant  Loveit coloured  bit his lips  wished to go  but had not the courage to move first  He waited to see what everybody else would do  nobody stirred  so Loveit stood still   Well  then  cried Tarlton  giving his hand to the boy next him  then to the next   your word and honour that you won  t betray me  but stand by me  and I  ll stand by you  Each boy gave his hand and his promise  repeating   Stand by me  and I  ll stand by you  Loveit hung back till the last  and had almost twisted off the button of the boy  s coat who screened him  when Tarlton came up  holding out his hand   Come  Loveit  lad  you  re in for it  stand by me  and I  ll stand by you   Indeed  Tarlton  expostulated he  without looking him in the face   I do wish you  d give up this scheme  I daresay all the apples are gone by this time  I wish you would  Do  pray  give up this scheme   What scheme  man  you have  n  t heard it yet  you may as well know your text before you begin preaching  The corners of Loveit  s mouth could not refuse to smile  though in his heart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh   Why  I don  t know you  I declare I don  t know you to  day  said Tarlton   you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world  and would do anything one asked you  but you  re quite altered of late  as we were saying just now  when you skulked away with Hardy  come  do  man  pluck up a little spirit  and be one of us  or you  ll make us all HATE YOU   HATE me  repeated Loveit  with terror   no  surely  you won  t all HATE me  and he mechanically stretched out his hand which Tarlton shook violently  saying   Ay  now  that  s right   Ay  now  that  s wrong  whispered Loveit  s conscience  but his conscience was of no use to him  for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers  and though he had the wish  he never had the power  to do right   Poor Loveit  I knew he would not refuse us  cried his companions  and even Tarlton  the moment he shook hands with him  despised him  It is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad  The league being thus formed  Tarlton assumed all the airs of commander  explained his schemes  and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old man  s apple  tree  It was the only one he had the world  We shall not dwell upon their consultation  for the amusement of contriving such expeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in them  There was a small window at the end of the back staircase  through which  between nine and ten o  clock at night  Tarlton  accompanied by Loveit and another boy  crept out  It was a moonlight night  and after crossing the field  and climbing the gate  directed by Loveit  who now resolved to go through the affair with spirit  they proceeded down the lane with rash yet fearful steps  At a distance Loveit saw the white washed cottage  and the apple  tree beside it  They quickened their pace  and with some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the garden  though not without being scratched and torn by the briers  Everything was silent  Yet now and then  at every rustling of the leaves  they started  and their hearts beat violently  Once  as Loveit was climbing the apple  tree  he thought he heard a door in the cottage open  and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home  This  however  he could by no means persuade them to do  until they had filled their pockets with apples  then  to his great joy  they returned  crept in at the window and each retired  as softly as possible  to his own apartment  Loveit slept in the room with Hardy  whom he had left fast asleep  and whom he now was extremely afraid of awakening  All the apples were emptied out of Loveit  s pockets  and lodged with Tarlton till the morning  for fear the smell should betray the secret to Hardy  The room door was apt to creak  but it was opened with such precaution  that no noise could be heard  and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him   Ah  said he to himself   how quietly he sleeps  I wish I had been sleeping too  The reproaches of Loveit  s conscience  however  served no other purpose but to torment him  he had not sufficient strength of mind to be good  The very next night  in spite of all his fears  and all his penitence  and all his resolutions  by a little fresh ridicule and persuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar expedition  We must observe  that the necessity for continuing their depredations became stronger the third day  for  though at first only a small party had been in the secret  by degrees it was divulged to the whole school  and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the booty  Everyone was astonished that Hardy  with all his quickness and penetration  had not yet discovered their proceedings  but Loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be  Loveit had strictly kept his promise of secrecy  but he was by no means an artful boy  and in talking to his friend  conscious that he had something to conceal  he was perpetually on the point of betraying himself  then recollecting his engagement  he blushed  stammered  bungled  and upon Hardy  s asking what he meant  would answer with a silly  guilty countenance  that he did not know  or abruptly break off  saying   Oh nothing  nothing at all  It was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult his friend  A gloom overspread Tarlton  s brow when he began to speak on the subject  and he always returned a peremptory refusal  accompanied with some such taunting expression as this  I wish we had nothing to do with such a sneaking fellow  he  ll betray us all  I see  before we have done with him   Well  said Loveit to himself   so I am abused after all  and called a sneaking fellow for my pains  that  s rather hard  to be sure  when I  ve got so little by the job  In truth he had not got much  for in the division of the booty only one apple  and half of another  which was only half ripe  happened to fall to his share  though  to be sure  when they had all eaten their apples  he had the satisfaction to hear everybody declare they were very sorry they had forgotten to offer some of theirs to  POOR LOVEIT  In the meantime  the visits to the apple  tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage  He used to examine his only tree very frequently  and missing numbers of rosy apples  which he had watched ripening  he  though not prone to suspicion  began to think that there was something going wrong  especially as a gap was made in his hedge  and there were several small footsteps in his flower beds  The good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living creature  much less to children  of whom he was particularly fond  Nor was he in the least avaricious  for though he was not rich  he had enough to live upon  because he had been very industrious in his youth  and he was always very ready to part with the little he had  Nor was he a cross old man  If anything would have made him angry  it would have been the seeing his favourite tree robbed  as he had promised himself the pleasure of giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday  However  he looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger  and leaning upon his staff  he began to consider what he had best do   If I complain to their master  said he to himself   they will certainly be flogged  and that I should be sorry for  yet they must not be let to go on stealing  that would be worse still  for it would surely bring them to the gallows in the end  Let me see  oh  ay  that will do  I will borrow farmer Kent  s dog Barker  he  ll keep them off  I  ll answer for it  Farmer Kent lent his dog Barker  cautioning his neighbour  at the same time  to be sure to chain him well  for he was the fiercest mastiff in England  The old man  with farmer Kent  s assistance  chained him fast to the trunk of the apple  tree  Night came  and Tarlton  Loveit and his companions  returned at the usual hour  Grown bolder now by frequent success  they came on talking and laughing  But the moment they had set their foot in the garden  the dog started up  and  shaking the chain as he sprang forward  barked with unremitting fury  They stood still as if fixed to the spot  There was just moonlight enough to see the dog   Let us try the other side of the tree  said Tarlton  But to whichever side they turned  the dog flew round in an instant  barking with increased fury   He  ll break his chain and tear us to pieces  cried Tarlton  and  struck with terror  he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him  and betook himself to flight  with the greatest precipitation   Help me  oh  pray  help me  I can  t get through the hedge  cried Loveit  in a lamentable tone  whilst the dog growled hideously  and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain   I can  t get out  Oh  for God  s sake  stay for me one minute  dear Tarlton  He called in vain  he was left to struggle through his difficulties by himself  and of all his dear friends not one turned back to help him  At last  torn and terrified  he got through the hedge and ran home  despising his companions for their selfishness  Nor could he help observing that Tarlton  with all his vaunted prowess  was the first to run away from the appearance of danger  The next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party with their conduct   Why could not you  any of you  stay one minute to help me  said he   We did not hear you call  answered one   I was so frightened  said another   I would not have turned back for the whole world   And you  Tarlton   I  said Tarlton   had not I enough to do to take care of myself  you blockhead  Everyone for himself in this world   So I see  said Loveit  gravely   Well  man  is there anything strange in that   Strange  why  yes  I thought you all loved me   Lord love you  lad  so we do  but we love ourselves better   Hardy would not have served me so  however  said Loveit  turning away in disgust  Tarlton was alarmed   Pugh  said he   what nonsense have you taken into your brain  Think no more about it  We are all very sorry  and beg your pardon  come  shake hands  forgive and forget  Loveit gave his hand  but gave it rather coldly   I forgive it with all my heart  said he   but I cannot forget it so soon   Why  then  you are not such a good humoured fellow as we thought you were  Surely you cannot bear malice  Loveit  Loveit smiled  and allowed that he certainly could not bear malice   Well  then  come  you know at the bottom we all love you  and would do anything in the world for you  Poor Loveit  flattered in his foible  began to believe that they did love him at the bottom  as they said  and even with his eyes open consented again to be duped   How strange it is  thought he   that I should set such value upon the love of those I despise  When I  m once out of this scrape  I  ll have no more to do with them  I  m determined  Compared with his friend Hardy  his new associates did indeed appear contemptible  for all this time Hardy had treated him with uniform kindness  avoided to pry into his secrets  yet seemed ready to receive his confidence  if it had been offered  After school in the evening  as he was standing silently beside Hardy  who was ruling a sheet of paper for him  Tarlton  in his brutal manner  came up  and seizing him by the arm  cried   Come along with me  Loveit  I  ve something to say to you   I can  t come now  said Loveit  drawing away his arm   Ah  do come now  said Tarlton  in a voice of persuasion   Well  I  ll come presently   Nay  but do  pray  there  s a good fellow  come now  because I have something to say to you   What is it you  ve got to say to me  I wish you  d let me alone  said Loveit  yet at the same time he suffered himself to he led away  Tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into temper again  and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings  went so far as to say   Loveit  the other day you wanted a top  I  ll give you mine if you desire it  Loveit thanked him  and was overjoyed at the thought of possessing this top   But what did you want to say to me just now   Ay  we  ll talk of that presently  not yet  when we get out of hearing   Nobody is near us  said Loveit   Come a little farther however  said Tarlton  looking round suspiciously   Well now  well   You know the dog that frightened us last night   Yes   It will never frighten us again   Won  t it  how so   Look here  said Tarlton  drawing something from his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief   What  s that  Tarlton opened it   Raw meat  exclaimed Loveit   How came you by it   Tom  the servant boy  Tom got it for me  and I  m to give him sixpence   And is it for the dog   Yes  I vowed I  d be revenged on him  and after this he  ll never bark again   Never bark again  What do you mean  Is it poison  exclaimed Loveit  starting back with horror   Only poison for A DOG  said Tarlton  confused   you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a Christian  Loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence   Tarlton  said he at last  in a changed tone and altered manner   I did not know you  I will have no more to do with you   Nay  but stay  said Tarlton  catching hold of his arm   stay  I was only joking   Let go my arm  you were in earnest   But then that was before I knew there was any harm  If you think there  s any harm   IF  said Loveit   Why  you know  I might not know  for Tom told me it  s a thing that  s often done  Ask Tom   I  ll ask nobody  Surely we know better what  s right and wrong than Tom does   But only just ask him  to hear what he  ll say   I don  t want to hear what he  ll say  cried Loveit  vehemently   the dog will die in agonies  in agonies  There was a dog poisoned at my father  s  I saw him in the yard  Poor creature  He lay and howled and writhed himself   Poor creature  Well  there  s no harm done now  cried Tarlton  in a hypocritical tone  But though he thought fit to dissemble with Loveit  he was thoroughly determined in his purpose  Poor Loveit  in haste to get away  returned to his friend Hardy  but his mind was in such agitation  that he neither talked nor moved like himself  and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready to burst into tears   How good  natured you are to me  said he to Hardy  as he was trying vainly to entertain him   but if you knew  Here he stopped short  for the bell for evening prayer rang  and they all took their places  and knelt down  After prayers  as they were going to bed  Loveit stopped Tarlton  WELL  asked he  in an inquiring manner  fixing his eyes upon him   WELL  replied Tarlton  in an audacious tone  as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance   What do you mean to do to  night   To go to sleep  as you do  I suppose  replied Tarlton  turning away abruptly  and whistling as he walked off   Oh  he has certainly changed his mind  said Loveit to himself   else he could not whistle  About ten minutes after this  as he and Hardy were undressing  Hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass   Oh  said he   it will be quite spoiled before morning   Call Tom  said Loveit   and bid him bring it in for you in a minute  They both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom  no one answered  They called again louder   Is Tom below   I  m here  answered he at last  coming out of Tarlton  s room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery  And as he was receiving Hardy  s commission  Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket  This excited fresh suspicions in Loveit  s mind  but  without saying one word  he immediately stationed himself at the window in his room  which looked out towards the lane  and  as the moon was risen  he could see if anyone passed that way   What are you doing there  said Hardy  after he had been watching some time   why don  t you come to bed  Loveit returned no answer  but continued standing at the window  Nor did he watch long in vain  Presently he saw Tom gliding slowly along a by  path  and get over the gate into the lane   He  s gone to do it  exclaimed Loveit aloud  with an emotion which he could not command   Who  s gone  to do what  cried Hardy  starting up   How cruel  how wicked  continued Loveit   What  s cruel  what  s wicked  speak out at once  returned Hardy  in that commanding tone which  in moments of danger  strong minds feel themselves entitled to assume towards weak ones  Loveit instantly  though in an incoherent manner  explained the affair to him  Scarcely had the words passed his lips  when Hardy sprang up  and began dressing himself without saying one syllable   For God  s sake  what are you going to do  said Loveit  in great anxiety   They  ll never forgive me  don  t betray me  they  ll never forgive  pray  speak to me  only say you won  t betray us   I will not betray you  trust to me  said Hardy  and he left the room  and Loveit stood in amazement  while  in the meantime  Hardy  in hopes of overtaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided  ran with all possible speed across the meadow  then down the lane  He came up with Tom just as he was climbing the bank into the old man  s garden  Hardy  too much out of breath to speak  seized hold of him  dragged him down  detaining him with a firm grasp  whilst he panted for utterance   What  Master Hardy  is it you  what  s the matter  what do you want   I want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket   Who told you that I had any such thing  said Tom  clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket   Give it me quietly  and I  ll let you off   Sir  upon my word I haven  t  I didn  t  I don  t know what you mean  said Tom  trembling  though he was by far the stronger of the two   Indeed  I don  t know what you mean   You do  said Hardy  with great indignation  and a violent struggle immediately commenced  The dog  now alarmed by the voices  began to bark outrageously  Tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter  his strength forsook him  and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge  he ran away with all his speed  The handkerchief fell within reach of the dog  who instantly snapped at it  luckily it did not come untied  Hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him  and  seizing upon it  stuck it into the handkerchief  The dog pulled  tore  growled  grappled  yelled  it was impossible to get the handkerchief from between his teeth  but the knot was loosed  the meat  unperceived by the dog  dropped out  and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph  Hardy  with inexpressible joy  plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned meat  and bore it away  Never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle  Full of the pleasure of successful benevolence  Hardy tripped joyfully home  and vaulted over the window sill  when the first object he beheld was Mr  Power  the usher  standing at the head of the stairs  with his candle in his hand   Come up  whoever you are  said Mr  William Power  in a stern voice   I thought I should find you out at last  Come up  whoever you are  Hardy obeyed without reply  Hardy  exclaimed Mr  Power  starting back with astonishment   is it you  Mr  Hardy  repeated he  holding the light to his face   Why  sir  said he  in a sneering tone   I  m sure if Mr  Trueman was here he wouldn  t believe his own eyes  but for my part I saw through you long since  I never liked saints  for my share  Will you please to do me the favour  sir  if it is not too much trouble  to empty your pockets  Hardy obeyed in silence   Heyday  meat  raw meat  what next   That  s all  said Hardy  emptying his pockets inside out   This is ALL  said Mr  Power  taking up the meat   Pray  sir  said Hardy  eagerly   let that meat be burned  it is poisoned   Poisoned  cried Mr  William Power  letting it drop out of his fingers   you wretch  looking at him with a menacing air   what is all this  Speak  Hardy was silent   Why don  t you speak  cried he  shaking him by the shoulder impatiently  Still Hardy was silent   Down upon your knees this minute and confess all  tell me where you  ve been  what you  ve been doing  and who are your accomplices  for I know there is a gang of you  so  added he  pressing heavily upon Hardy  s shoulder   down upon your knees this minute  and confess the whole  that  s your only way now to get off yourself  If you hope for MY pardon  I can tell you it  s not to be had without asking for   Sir  said Hardy  in a firm but respectful voice   I have no pardon to ask  I have nothing to confess  I am innocent  but if I were not  I would never try to get off myself by betraying my companions   Very well  sir  very well  very fine  stick to it  stick to it  I advise you  and we shall see  And how will you look to  morrow  Mr  Innocent  when my uncle  the doctor  comes home   As I do now  sir  said Hardy  unmoved  His composure threw Mr  Power into a rage too great for utterance   Sir  continued Hardy   ever since I have been at school  I never told a lie  and therefore  sir  I hope you will believe me now  Upon my word and honour  sir  I have done nothing wrong   Nothing wrong  Better and better  what  when I caught you going out at night   THAT  to be sure  was wrong  said Hardy  recollecting himself   but except that   Except that  sir  I will except nothing  Come along with me  young gentleman  your time for pardon is past  Saying these words  he pulled Hardy along a narrow passage to a small closet  set apart for desperate offenders  and usually known by the name of the BLACK HOLE   There  sir  take up your lodging there for to  night  said he  pushing him in   tomorrow I  ll know more  or I  ll know why  added he  double locking the door  with a tremendous noise  upon his prisoner  and locking also the door at the end of the passage  so that no one could have access to him   So now I think I have you safe  said Mr  William Power to himself  stalking off with steps which made the whole gallery resound  and which made many a guilty heart tremble  The conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr  Power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to  but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard  The locking of the black hole door was a terrible sound  some knew not what it portended  and others knew TOO WELL  All assembled in the morning with faces of anxiety  Tarlton and Loveit  s were the most agitated  Tarlton for himself  Loveit for his friend  for himself  for everybody  Every one of the party  and Tarlton at their head  surrounded him with reproaches  and considered him as the author of the evils which hung over them   How could you do so  and why did you say anything to Hardy about it  when you had promised  too  Oh  what shall we all do  what a scrape you have brought us into  Loveit  it  s all your fault   ALL MY FAULT  repeated poor Loveit  with a sigh   well  that is hard   Goodness  there  s the bell  exclaimed a number of voices at once   Now for it  They all stood in a half circle for morning prayers  They listened  Here he is coming  No  Yes  Here he is  And Mr  William Power  with a gloomy brow  appeared and walked up to his place at the head of the room  They knelt down to prayers  and the moment they rose  Mr  William Power  laying his hand upon the table  cried   Stand still  gentlemen  if you please  Everybody stood stock still  he walked out of the circle  they guessed that he was gone for Hardy  and the whole room was in commotion  Each with eagerness asked each what none could answer   HAS HE TOLD   WHAT has he told   Who has he told of   I hope he has not told of me  cried they   I  ll answer for it he has told of all of us  said Tarlton   And I  ll answer for it he has told of none of us  answered Loveit  with a sigh   You don  t think he  s such a fool  when he can get himself off  said Tarlton  At this instant the prisoner was led in  and as he passed through the circle  every eye was fixed upon him  His eye fell upon no one  not even upon Loveit  who pulled him by the coat as he passed  everyone felt almost afraid to breathe   Well  sir  said Mr  Power  sitting down in Mr  Trueman  s elbow  chair  and placing the prisoner opposite to him   well  sir  what have you to say to me this morning   Nothing  sir  answered Hardy  in a decided  yet modest manner   nothing but what I said last night   Nothing more   Nothing more  sir   But I have something more to say to you  sir  then  and a great deal more  I promise you  before I have done with you  and then  seizing him in a fury  he was just going to give him a severe flogging  when the schoolroom door opened  and Mr  Trueman appeared  followed by an old man whom Loveit immediately knew  He leaned upon his stick as he walked  and in his other hand carried a basket of apples  When they came within the circle  Mr  Trueman stopped short   Hardy  exclaimed he  with a voice of unfeigned surprise  whilst Mr  William Power stood with his hand suspended  Ay  Hardy  sir  repeated he   I told him you  d not believe your own eyes  Mr  Trueman advanced with a slow step   Now  sir  give me leave  said the usher  eagerly drawing him aside  and whispering   So  sir  said Mr  T  when the whisper was done  addressing himself to Hardy  with a voice and manner which  had he been guilty  must have pierced him to the heart   I find I have been deceived in you  it is but three hours ago that I told your uncle I never had a boy in my school in whom I placed so much confidence  but  after all this show of honour and integrity  the moment my back is turned  you are the first to set an example of disobedience of my orders  Why do I talk of disobeying my commands  you are a thief   I  sir  exclaimed Hardy  no longer able to repress his feelings   You  sir  you and some others  said Mr  Trueman  looking round the room with a penetrating glance  you and some others   Ay  sir  interrupted Mr  William Power   get that out of him if you can  ask him   I will ask him nothing  I shall neither put his truth nor his honour to the trial  truth and honour are not to be expected amongst thieves   I am not a thief  I have never had anything to do with thieves  cried Hardy  indignantly   Have you not robbed this old man  Don  t you know the taste of these apples  said Mr  Trueman  taking one out of the basket   No  sir  I do not  I never touched one of that old man  s apples   Never touched one of them  I suppose this is some vile equivocation  you have done worse  you have had the barbarity  the baseness  to attempt to poison his dog  the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last night   The poisoned meat was found in my pocket  sir  but I never intended to poison the dog  I saved his life   Lord bless him  said the old man   Nonsense  cunning  said Mr  Power   I hope you won  t let him impose upon you  sir   No  he cannot impose upon me  I have a proof he is little prepared for  said Mr  Trueman  producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped  Tarlton turned pale  Hardy  s countenance never changed   Don  t you know this handkerchief  sir   I do  sir   Is it not yours   No  sir   Don  t you know whose it is  cried Mr  Power  Hardy was silent   Now  gentlemen  said Mr  Trueman   I am not fond of punishing you  but when I do it  you know  it is always in earnest  I will begin with the eldest of you  I will begin with Hardy  and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned   I  m sure it  s not mine  and  I  m sure it  s none of mine  burst from every mouth  whilst they looked at each other in dismay  for none but Hardy  Loveit and Tarlton knew the secret   My cane  said Mr  Trueman  and Mr  Power handed him the cane  Loveit groaned from the bottom of his heart  Tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black countenance  Hardy looked with a steady eye at the cane   But first  said Mr  Trueman  laying down the cane   let us see  Perhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way  examining the corners  It was torn almost to pieces  but luckily the corner that was marked remained   J  T  cried Mr  Trueman  Every eye turned upon the guilty Tarlton  who  now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb  sank down upon his knees  and in a whining voice begged for mercy   Upon my word and honour  sir  I  ll tell you all  I  d never have thought of stealing the apples if Loveit had not first told me of them  and it was Tom who first put the poisoning the dog into my head  It was he that carried the meat  WASN  T IT  said he  appealing to Hardy  whose word he knew must be believed   Oh  dear sir  continued he as Mr  Trueman began to move towards him   do let me off  pray do let me off this time  I  m not the only one  indeed  sir  I hope you won  t make me an example for the rest  It  s very hard I  m to be flogged more than they   I  m not going to flog you   Thank you  sir  said Tarlton  getting up and wiping his eyes   You need not thank me  said Mr  Trueman   Take your handkerchief  go out of this room  out of this house  let me never see you more   If I had any hopes of him  said Mr  Trueman  as he shut the door after him  if I had any hopes of him  I would have punished him  but I have none  Punishment is meant only to make people better  and those who have any hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it  At these words Loveit first  and immediately all the rest of the guilty party  stepped out of the ranks  confessed their fault  and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper   Oh  they have been punished enough  said the old man   forgive them  sir  Hardy looked as if he wished to speak   Not because you ask it  said Mr  Trueman to the guilty penitents   though I should be glad to oblige you  it wouldn  t be just  but there  pointing to Hardy   there is one who has merited a reward  the highest I can give him is that of pardoning his companions  Hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure  whilst everybody present sympathized in his feelings   I am sure  thought Loveit   this is a lesson I shall never forget   Gentlemen  said the old man  with a faltering voice   it wasn  t for the sake of my apples that I spoke  and you  sir  said he to Hardy   I thank you for saving my dog  If you please  I  ll plant on that mount  opposite the window  a young apple  tree  from my old one  I will water it  and take care of it with my own hands for your sake  as long as I am able  And may God bless you  laying his trembling hand on Hardy  s head   may God bless you  I  m sure God WILL bless all such boys as you are  THE BASKET  WOMAN   Toute leur etude etait de se complaire et de s  entr  aider   PAUL ET VIRGINIE  At the foot of a steep  slippery  white hill  near Dunstable  in Bedfordshire  called Chalk Hill  there is a hut  or rather a hovel  which travellers could scarcely suppose could be inhabited  if they did not see the smoke rising from its peaked roof  An old woman lives in this hovel   and with her a little boy and girl  the children of a beggar who died  and left these orphans perishing with hunger  They thought themselves very happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid them warm themselves at her small fire  and gave them a crust of mouldy bread to eat  She had not much to give  but what she had she gave with good  will  She was very kind to these poor children  and worked hard at her spinning  wheel and at her knitting  to support herself and them  She earned money also in another way  She used to follow all the carriages as they went up Chalk Hill  and when the horses stopped to take breath or to rest themselves  she put stones behind the carriage wheels to prevent them from rolling backwards down the steep  slippery hill    Their whole study was how to please and to help one another   This was about the close of the th century  The little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old woman  s spinning  wheel when she was spinning  and to talk to her  At these times she taught them something  which  she said  she hoped they would remember all their lives  She explained to them what is meant by telling the truth  and what it is to be honest  She taught them to dislike idleness  and to wish that they could be useful  One evening  as they were standing beside her  the little boy said to her   Grandmother  for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call her  grandmother  how often you are forced to get up from your spinning  wheel  and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill  to put stones underneath the wheels  to hinder them from rolling back  The people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this  don  t they   Yes  child   But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that hill  You often say that you are tired  and then you know that you cannot spin all that time  Now if we might go up the hill  and put the stones behind the wheels  you could sit still at your work  and would not the people give us the halfpence  and could not we bring them all to you  Do  pray  dear grandmother  try us for one day  to  morrow  will you   Yes  said the old woman   I will try what you can do  but I must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times  for fear you should get yourselves hurt  So  the next day  the little boy and girl went with their grandmother  as they used to call her  up the steep hill  and she showed the boy how to prevent the wheels from rolling back  by putting stones behind them  and she said   This is called scotching the wheels  and she took off the boy  s hat and gave it to the little girl  to hold up to the carriage  windows  ready for the halfpence  When she thought that the children knew how to manage by themselves  she left them  and returned to her spinning  wheel  A great many carriages happened to go by this day  and the little girl received a great many halfpence  She carried them all in her brother  s hat to her grandmother in the evening  and the old woman smiled  and thanked the children  She said that they had been useful to her  and that her spinning had gone on finely  because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day   But  Paul my boy  said she   what is the matter with your hand   Only a pinch  only one pinch that I got  as I was putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise  It does not hurt me much  grandmother  and I  ve thought of a good thing for to  morrow  I shall never be hurt again  if you will only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken crutch  grandmother  and the block of wood that lies in the chimney  corner  and that is of no use  I  ll make it of some use  if I may have it   Take it then  dear  said the old woman   and you  ll find the handle of the broken crutch under my bed  Paul went to work immediately  and fastened one end of the pole into the block of wood  so as to make something like a dry  rubbing brush   Look  grandmamma  look at my SCOTCHER  I call this thing my SCOTCHER  said Paul   because I shall always scotch the wheels with it  I shall never pinch my fingers again  my hands  you see  will be safe at the end of this long stick  and  sister Anne  you need not be at the trouble of carrying any more stones after me up the hill  we shall never want stones any more  My scotcher will do without anything else  I hope  I wish it was morning  and that a carriage would come  that I might run up the hill  and try my scotcher   And I wish that as many chaises may go by to  morrow as there did to  day  and that we may bring you as many halfpence  grandmother  said the little girl   So do I  my dear Anne  said the old woman   for I mean that you and your brother shall have all the money that you get to  morrow  You may buy some gingerbread for yourselves  or some of those ripe plums that you saw at the fruit  stall the other day  which is just going into Dunstable  I told you then that I could not afford to buy such things for you  but now that you can earn halfpence for yourselves  children  it is fair should taste a ripe plum and bit of gingerbread for once and a way in your lives   We  ll bring some of the gingerbread home to her  shan  t we  brother  whispered little Anne  The morning came  but no carriages were heard  though Paul and his sister had risen at five o  clock  that they might be sure to be ready for early travellers  Paul kept his scotcher poised upon his shoulder  and watched eagerly at his station at the bottom of the hill  He did not wait long before a carriage came  He followed it up the hill  and the instant the postillion called to him  and bid him stop the wheels  he put his scotcher behind them  and found that it answered the purpose perfectly well  Many carriages went by this day  and Paul and Anne received a great many halfpence from the travellers  When it grew dusk in the evening  Anne said to her brother  I don  t think any more carriages will come by to  day  Let us count the halfpence  and carry them home now to grandmother   No  not yet  answered Paul   let them alone  let them lie still in the hole where I have put them  I daresay more carriages will come by before it is quite dark  and then we shall have more halfpence  Paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat  and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside  and Anne said she would not meddle with them  and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them  and Paul said  If you will stay and watch here  I will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field  Stand you hereabouts  half  way up the hill  and the moment you see any carriage coming along the road  run as fast as you can and call me  Anne waited a long time  or what she thought a long time  and she saw no carriage  and she trailed her brother  s scotcher up and down till she was tired  Then she stood still  and looked again  and she saw no carriage  so she went sorrowfully into the field  and to the hedge where her brother was gathering blackberries  and she said   Paul  I  m sadly tired  SADLY TIRED  said she   and my eyes are quite strained with looking for chaises  no more chaises will come to  night  and your scotcher is lying there  of no use  upon the ground  Have not I waited long enough for to  day  Paul   Oh  no  said Paul   here are some blackberries for you  you had better wait a little bit longer  Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me  Anne  who was of a very obliging temper  and who liked to do what she was asked to do  went back to the place where the scotcher lay  and scarcely had she reached the spot  when she heard the noise of a carriage  She ran to call her brother  and to their great joy  they now saw four chaises coming towards them  Paul  as soon as they went up the hill  followed with his scotcher  first he scotched the wheels of one carriage  then of another  and Anne was so much delighted with observing how well the scotcher stopped the wheels  and how much better it was than stones  that she forgot to go and hold her brother  s hat to the travellers for halfpence  till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl  who was looking out of the window of one of the chaises   Come close to the chaise  door  said the little girl   here are some halfpence for you  Anne held the hat  and she afterwards went on to the other carriages  Money was thrown to her from each of them  and when they had all gotten safely to the top of the hill  she and her brother sat down upon a large stone by the roadside  to count their treasure  First they began by counting what was in the hat  One  two  three  four halfpence   But  oh  brother  look at this  exclaimed Anne   this is not the same as the other halfpence   No  indeed  it is not  cried Paul   it is no halfpenny  it is a guinea  a bright golden guinea   Is it  said Anne  who had never seen a guinea in her life before  and who did not know its value   and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy gingerbread  I  ll run to the fruit  stall  and ask the woman  shall I   No  no  said Paul   you need not ask any woman  or anybody but me  I can tell you all about it  as well as anybody in the whole world   The whole world  Oh  Paul  you forgot  Not so well as my grandmother   Why  not so well as my grandmother  perhaps  but  Anne  I can tell you that you must not talk yourself  Anne  but you must listen to me quietly  or else you won  t understand what I am going to tell you  for I can assure you that I don  t think I quite understood it myself  Anne  the first time my grandmother told it to me  though I stood stock still listening my best  Prepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be understood  Anne looked very grave  and her brother explained to her  that  with a guinea  she might buy two hundred and fifty  two times as many plums as she could get for a penny   Why  Paul  you know the fruit  woman said she would give us a dozen plums for a penny  Now  for this little guinea  would she give us two hundred and fifty  two dozen   If she has so many  and if we like to have so many  to be sure she will  said Paul   but I think we should not like to have two hundred and fifty  two dozen of plums  we could not eat such a number   But we could give some of them to my grandmother  said Anne   But still there would be too many for her  and for us  too  said Paul   and when we had eaten the plums  there would be an end to all the pleasure  But now I  ll tell you what I am thinking of  Anne  that we might buy something for my grandmother  that would be very useful to her indeed  with the guinea  something that would last a great while   What  brother  What sort of thing   Something that she said she wanted very much last winter  when she was so ill with the rheumatism  something that she said yesterday  when you were making her bed  she wished she might be able to buy before next winter   I know  I know what you mean  said Anne  a blanket  Oh  yes  Paul  that will be much better than plums  do let us buy a blanket for her  how glad she will be to see it  I will make her bed with the new blanket  and then bring her to see it  But  Paul  how shall we buy a blanket  Where are blankets to be got   Leave that to me  I  ll manage that  I know where blankets can be got  I saw one hanging out of a shop the day I went last to Dunstable   You have seen a great many things at Dunstable  brother   Yes  a great many  but I never saw anything there or anywhere else  that I wished for half so much as I did for the blanket for my grandmother  Do you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter  I  ll buy the blanket to  morrow  I  m going to Dunstable with her spinning   And you  ll bring the blanket to me  and I shall make the bed very neatly  that will be all right  all happy  said Anne  clapping her hands   But stay  Hush  don  t clap your hands so  Anne  it will not be all happy  I  m afraid  said Paul  and his countenance changed  and he looked very grave   It will not be all right  I  m afraid  for there is one thing we have neither of us thought of  but that we ought to think about  We cannot buy the blanket  I  m afraid   Why  Paul  why   Because I don  t think this guinea is honestly ours   Nay  brother  but I  m sure it is honestly ours  It was given to us  and grandmother said all that was given to us to  day was to be our own   But who gave it to you  Anne   Some of the people in those chaises  Paul  I don  t know which of them  but I daresay it was the little rosy girl   No  said Paul   for when she called you to the chaise door  she said   Here  s some halfpence for you  Now  if she gave you the guinea  she must have given it to you by mistake   Well  but perhaps some of the people in the other chaises gave it to me  and did not give it to me by mistake  Paul  There was a gentleman reading in one of the chaises and a lady  who looked very good  naturedly at me  and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of the window  and looked at your scotcher  brother  and he asked me if that was your own making  and when I said yes  and that I was your sister he smiled at me  and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket  and threw a handful of halfpence into the hat  and I daresay he gave us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so much   Why  said Paul   that might be  to be sure  but I wish I was quite certain of it   Then  as we are not quite certain  had not we best go and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it  Paul thought this was excellent advice  and he was not a silly boy  who did not like to follow good advice  He went with his sister directly to his grandmother  showed her the guinea  and told her how they came by it   My dear  honest children  said she   I am very glad you told me all this  I am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea  I  m sure it is not honestly ours  Those who threw it you gave it you by mistake  I warrant  and what I would have you do is  to go to Dunstable  and try if you can  at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you  It is now so late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at Dunstable  instead of going on the next stage  and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time  All you can do is to go and inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the chaise   Oh  interrupted Paul   I know a good way of finding him out  I remember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels  and I remember I read the innkeeper  s name upon the chaise   John Nelson  ( I am much obliged to you for teaching me to read  grandmother ) You told me yesterday  grandmother  that the names written upon chaises are the innkeepers to whom they belong  I read the name of the innkeeper upon that chaise  It was John Nelson  So Anne and I will go to both the inns in Dunstable  and try to find out this chaise  John Nelson  s  Come  Anne  let us set out before it gets quite dark  Anne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that was covered with gingerbread and ripe plums  and pursued their way steadily through the streets of Dunstable  but Paul  when he came to the shop where he had seen the blanket  stopped for a moment  and said   It is a great pity  Anne  that the guinea is not ours  However  we are doing what is honest  and that is a comfort  Here  we must go through this gateway  into the inn  yard  we are come to the  Dun Cow   Cow  said Anne   I see no cow   Look up  and you  ll see the cow over your head  said Paul  the sign  the picture  Come  never mind looking at it now  I want to find out the green chaise that has John Nelson  s name upon it  Paul pushed forward  through a crowded passage  till he got into the inn  yard  There was a great noise and bustle  The hostlers were carrying in luggage  The postillions were rubbing down the horses  or rolling the chaises into the coach  house   What now  What business have you here  pray  said a waiter  who almost ran over Paul  as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from the bottle  rack   You  ve no business here  crowding up the yard  Walk off  young gentleman  if you please   Pray give me leave  sir  said Paul   to stay a few minutes  to look amongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels  that has Mr  John Nelson  s name written upon it   What  s that he says about a dark green chaise  said one of the postillions   What should such a one as he is know about chaises  interrupted the hasty waiter  and he vas going to turn Paul out of the yard  but the hostler caught hold of his arm and said   Maybe the child has some business here  let  s know what he has to say for himself  The waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend the bell  and Paul told his business to the hostler  who as soon as he saw the guinea and heard the story  shook Paul by the hand  and said   Stand steady  my honest lad  I  ll find the chaise for you  if it is to be found here  but John Nelson  s chaises almost always drive to the  Black Bull  After some difficulty  the green chaise  with John Nelson  s name upon it  and the postillion who drove that chaise  were found  and the postillion told Paul that he was just going into the parlour to the gentleman he had driven  to be paid  and that he would carry the guinea with him   No  said Paul   we should like to give it back ourselves   Yes  said the hostler   that they have a right to do  The postillion made no reply  but looked vexed  and went towards the house  desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return  In the passage there was standing a decent  clean  good natured looking woman  with two huge straw baskets on each side of her  One of the baskets stood a little in the way of the entrance  A man who was pushing his way in  and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a pole  impatient at being stopped  kicked down the straw basket  and all its contents were thrown out  Bright straw hats  and boxes  and slippers  were all thrown in disorder upon the dirty ground   Oh  they will be trampled upon  They will be all spoiled  exclaimed the woman to whom they belonged   We  ll help you to pick them up if you will let us  cried Paul and Anne  and they immediately ran to her assistance  When the things were all safe in the basket again  the children expressed a desire to know how such beautiful things could be made of straw  but the woman had not time to answer before the postillion came out of the parlour  and with him a gentleman  s servant  who came to Paul  and clapping him upon the back  said   So  my little chap  I gave you a guinea for a halfpenny  I hear  and I understand you  ve brought it back again  that  s right  give me hold of it   No  brother  said Anne   this is not the gentleman that was reading   Pooh  child  I came in Mr  Nelson  s green chaise  Here  s the postillion can tell you so  I and my master came in that chaise  I and my master that was reading  as you say  and it was he that threw the money out to you  He is going to bed  he is tired and can  t see you himself  He desires that you  ll give me the guinea  He pushed them towards the door  but the basket  woman whispered to them as they went out   Wait in the street till I come to you   Pray  Mrs  Landlady  cried this gentleman  s servant  addressing himself to the landlady  who just then came out of a room where some company were at supper   Pray  Mrs  Landlady  please to let me have roasted larks for my supper  You are famous for larks at Dunstable  and I make it a rule to taste the best of everything wherever I go  and  waiter  let me have a bottle of claret  Do you hear   Larks and claret for his supper  said the basket  woman to herself  as she looked at him from head to foot  The postillion was still waiting  as if to speak to him  and she observed them afterwards whispering and laughing together   NO BAD HIT  was a sentence which the servant pronounced several times  Now it occurred to the basket  woman that this man had cheated the children out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret  and she thought that perhaps she could discover the truth  She waited quietly in the passage   Waiter  Joe  Joe  cried the landlady   why don  t you carry in the sweetmeat  puffs and the tarts here to the company in the best parlour   Coming  ma  am  answered the waiter  and with a large dish of tarts and puffs  the waiter came from the bar  the landlady threw open the door of the best parlour  to let him in  and the basket  woman had now a full view of a large cheerful company  and amongst them several children  sitting round a supper  table   Ay  whispered the landlady  as the door closed after the waiter and the tarts   there are customers enough  I warrant  for you in that room  if you had but the luck to be called in  Pray  what would you have the conscience  I wonder now  to charge me for these here half  dozen little mats to put under my dishes   A trifle  ma  am  said the basket  woman  She let the landlady have the mats cheap  and the landlady then declared she would step in and see if the company in the best parlour had done supper   When they come to their wine  added she   I  ll speak a good word for you  and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed  The landlady  after the usual speech of   I hope the supper and everything is to your liking  ladies and gentlemen  began with   If any of the young gentlemen or ladies would have a CUR  OSITY to see any of our famous Dunstable straw  work  there  s a decent body without would  I daresay  be proud to show them her pincushion  boxes  and her baskets and slippers  and her other CUR  OSITIES  The eyes of the children all turned towards their mother  their mother smiled  and immediately their father called in the basket  woman  and desired her to produce her CURIOSITIES  The children gathered round her large pannier as it opened  but they did not touch any of her things   Ah  papa  cried a little rosy girl   here are a pair of straw slippers that would just fit you  I think  but would not straw shoes wear out very soon  and would not they let in the wet   Yes  my dear  said her father   but these slippers are meant   For powdering  slippers  miss  interrupted the basket  woman   To wear when people are powdering their hair  continued the gentleman   that they may not spoil their other shoes   And will you buy them  papa   No  I cannot indulge myself  said her father   in buying them now  I must make amends  said he  laughing   for my carelessness  and as I threw away a guinea to  day  I must endeavour to save sixpence at least   Ah  the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl  s hat as we were coming up Chalk Hill  Mamma  I wonder that the little girl did not take notice of its being a guinea  and that she did not run after the chaise to give it back again  I should think  if she had been an honest girl  she would have returned it   Miss  ma  am  sir  said the basket  woman   if it would not be impertinent  may I speak a word  A little boy and girl have just been here inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by mistake  and not five minutes ago I saw the boy give the guinea to a gentleman  s servant  who is there without  and who said his master desired it should be returned to him   There must be some mistake  or some trick in this  said the gentleman   Are the children gone  I must see them  send after them   I  ll go for them myself  said the good natured basket  woman   I bid them wait in the street yonder  for my mind misgave me that the man who spoke so short to them was a cheat  with his larks and his claret  Paul and Anne were speedily summoned  and brought back by their friend the basket  woman  and Anne  the moment she saw the gentleman  knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her  who admired her brother  s scotcher  and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat  but she could not be certain  she said  that she received the guinea from him  she only thought it most likely that she did   But I can be certain whether the guinea you returned be mine or no  said the gentleman   I marked the guinea  it was a light one  the only guinea I had  which I put into my waistcoat pocket this morning  He rang the bell  and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the room opposite to him know that he wished to see him   The gentleman in the white parlour  sir  do you mean   I mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child   He is a Mr  Pembroke  sir  said the waiter  Mr  Pembroke came  and as soon as he heard what had happened  he desired the waiter to show him to the room where his servant was at supper  The dishonest servant  who was supping upon larks and claret  knew nothing of what was going on  but his knife and fork dropped from his hand  and he overturned a bumper of claret as he started up from the table  in great surprise and terror  when his master came in with a face of indignation  and demanded  THE GUINEA  the GUINEA  sir  that you got from this child  that guinea which you said I ordered you to ask for from this child  The servant  confounded and half intoxicated  could only stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him  and that he really did not know which it was  He pulled his money out  and spread it upon the table with trembling hands  The marked guinea appeared  His master instantly turned him out of his service with strong expressions of contempt   And now  my little honest girl  said the gentleman who had admired her brother  s scotcher  turning to Anne   and now tell me who you are  and what you and your brother want or wish for most in the world  In the same moment Anne and Paul exclaimed   The thing we wish for the most in the world is a blanket for our grandmother   She is not our grandmother in reality  I believe  sir  said Paul   but she is just as good to us  and taught me to read  and taught Anne to knit  and taught us both that we should be honest  so she has  and I wish she had a new blanket before next winter  to keep her from the cold and the rheumatism  She had the rheumatism sadly last winter  sir  and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her   She shall have it  then  and  continued the gentleman   I will do something more for you  Do you like to be employed or to be idle best   We like to have something to do always  if we could  sir  said Paul   but we are forced to be idle sometimes  because grandmother has not always things for us to do that we CAN do well   Should you like to learn how to make such baskets as these  said the gentleman  pointing to one of the Dunstable straw  baskets   Oh  very much  said Paul   Very much  said Anne   Then I should like to teach you how to make them  said the basket  woman   for I  m sure of one thing  that you  d behave honestly to me  The gentleman put a guinea into the good natured basket  woman  s hand  and told her that he knew she could not afford to teach them her trade for nothing   I shall come through Dunstable again in a few months  added he   and I hope to see that you and your scholars are going on well  If I find that they are  I will do something more for you   But  said Anne   we must tell all this to grandmother  and ask her about it  and I  m afraid  though I  m very happy  that it is getting very late  and that we should not stay here any longer   It is a fine moonlight night  said the basket  woman   and is not far  I  ll walk with you  and see you safe home myself  The gentleman detained them a few minutes longer  till a messenger whom he had dispatched to purchase the much wished for blanket returned   Your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket  I hope  said the gentleman  as he gave it into Paul  s opened arms   It has been obtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children \n"

      "[ Emma by Jane Austen  ] VOLUME I CHAPTER I Emma Woodhouse  handsome  clever  and rich  with a comfortable home and happy disposition  seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence  and had lived nearly twenty  one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her  She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate  indulgent father  and had  in consequence of her sister  s marriage  been mistress of his house from a very early period  Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses  and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess  who had fallen little short of a mother in affection  Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr  Woodhouse  s family  less as a governess than a friend  very fond of both daughters  but particularly of Emma  Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters  Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess  the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint  and the shadow of authority being now long passed away  they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached  and Emma doing just what she liked  highly esteeming Miss Taylor  s judgment  but directed chiefly by her own  The real evils  indeed  of Emma  s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way  and a disposition to think a little too well of herself  these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments  The danger  however  was at present so unperceived  that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her  Sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness  Miss Taylor married  It was Miss Taylor  s loss which first brought grief  It was on the wedding  day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance  The wedding over  and the bride  people gone  her father and herself were left to dine together  with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening  Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner  as usual  and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost  The event had every promise of happiness for her friend  Mr  Weston was a man of unexceptionable character  easy fortune  suitable age  and pleasant manners  and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self  denying  generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match  but it was a black morning  s work for her  The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day  She recalled her past kindness  the kindness  the affection of sixteen years  how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old  how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health  and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood  A large debt of gratitude was owing here  but the intercourse of the last seven years  the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella  s marriage  on their being left to each other  was yet a dearer  tenderer recollection  She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed  intelligent  well  informed  useful  gentle  knowing all the ways of the family  interested in all its concerns  and peculiarly interested in herself  in every pleasure  every scheme of hers  one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose  and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault  How was she to bear the change  It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them  but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs  Weston  only half a mile from them  and a Miss Taylor in the house  and with all her advantages  natural and domestic  she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude  She dearly loved her father  but he was no companion for her  He could not meet her in conversation  rational or playful  The evil of the actual disparity in their ages  and Mr  Woodhouse had not married early  was much increased by his constitution and habits  for having been a valetudinarian all his life  without activity of mind or body  he was a much older man in ways than in years  and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper  his talents could not have recommended him at any time  Her sister  though comparatively but little removed by matrimony  being settled in London  only sixteen miles off  was much beyond her daily reach  and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield  before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband  and their little children  to fill the house  and give her pleasant society again  Highbury  the large and populous village  almost amounting to a town  to which Hartfield  in spite of its separate lawn  and shrubberies  and name  did really belong  afforded her no equals  The Woodhouses were first in consequence there  All looked up to them  She had many acquaintance in the place  for her father was universally civil  but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day  It was a melancholy change  and Emma could not but sigh over it  and wish for impossible things  till her father awoke  and made it necessary to be cheerful  His spirits required support  He was a nervous man  easily depressed  fond of every body that he was used to  and hating to part with them  hating change of every kind  Matrimony  as the origin of change  was always disagreeable  and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter  s marrying  nor could ever speak of her but with compassion  though it had been entirely a match of affection  when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too  and from his habits of gentle selfishness  and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself  he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them  and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield  Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could  to keep him from such thoughts  but when tea came  it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner   Poor Miss Taylor  I wish she were here again  What a pity it is that Mr  Weston ever thought of her   I cannot agree with you  papa  you know I cannot  Mr  Weston is such a good  humoured  pleasant  excellent man  that he thoroughly deserves a good wife  and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever  and bear all my odd humours  when she might have a house of her own   A house of her own  But where is the advantage of a house of her own  This is three times as large  And you have never any odd humours  my dear   How often we shall be going to see them  and they coming to see us  We shall be always meeting  _We_ must begin  we must go and pay wedding visit very soon   My dear  how am I to get so far  Randalls is such a distance  I could not walk half so far   No  papa  nobody thought of your walking  We must go in the carriage  to be sure   The carriage  But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way  and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit   They are to be put into Mr  Weston  s stable  papa  You know we have settled all that already  We talked it all over with Mr  Weston last night  And as for James  you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls  because of his daughter  s being housemaid there  I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else  That was your doing  papa  You got Hannah that good place  Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her  James is so obliged to you   I am very glad I did think of her  It was very lucky  for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account  and I am sure she will make a very good servant  she is a civil  pretty  spoken girl  I have a great opinion of her  Whenever I see her  she always curtseys and asks me how I do  in a very pretty manner  and when you have had her here to do needlework  I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it  I am sure she will be an excellent servant  and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter  you know  she will be hearing of us  He will be able to tell her how we all are  Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas  and hoped  by the help of backgammon  to get her father tolerably through the evening  and be attacked by no regrets but her own  The backgammon  table was placed  but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary  Mr  Knightley  a sensible man about seven or eight  and  thirty  was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family  but particularly connected with it  as the elder brother of Isabella  s husband  He lived about a mile from Highbury  was a frequent visitor  and always welcome  and at this time more welcome than usual  as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London  He had returned to a late dinner  after some days  absence  and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square  It was a happy circumstance  and animated Mr  Woodhouse for some time  Mr  Knightley had a cheerful manner  which always did him good  and his many inquiries after  poor Isabella  and her children were answered most satisfactorily  When this was over  Mr  Woodhouse gratefully observed   It is very kind of you  Mr  Knightley  to come out at this late hour to call upon us  I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk   Not at all  sir  It is a beautiful moonlight night  and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire   But you must have found it very damp and dirty  I wish you may not catch cold   Dirty  sir  Look at my shoes  Not a speck on them   Well  that is quite surprising  for we have had a vast deal of rain here  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast  I wanted them to put off the wedding   By the bye  I have not wished you joy  Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling  I have been in no hurry with my congratulations  but I hope it all went off tolerably well  How did you all behave  Who cried most   Ah  poor Miss Taylor   Tis a sad business   Poor Mr  and Miss Woodhouse  if you please  but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor  I have a great regard for you and Emma  but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence  At any rate  it must be better to have only one to please than two   Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful  troublesome creature  said Emma playfully   That is what you have in your head  I know  and what you would certainly say if my father were not by   I believe it is very true  my dear  indeed  said Mr  Woodhouse  with a sigh   I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome   My dearest papa  You do not think I could mean _you_  or suppose Mr  Knightley to mean _you_  What a horrible idea  Oh no  I meant only myself  Mr  Knightley loves to find fault with me  you know  in a joke  it is all a joke  We always say what we like to one another  Mr  Knightley  in fact  was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse  and the only one who ever told her of them  and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself  she knew it would be so much less so to her father  that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body   Emma knows I never flatter her  said Mr  Knightley   but I meant no reflection on any body  Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please  she will now have but one  The chances are that she must be a gainer   Well  said Emma  willing to let it pass  you want to hear about the wedding  and I shall be happy to tell you  for we all behaved charmingly  Every body was punctual  every body in their best looks  not a tear  and hardly a long face to be seen  Oh no  we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart  and were sure of meeting every day   Dear Emma bears every thing so well  said her father   But  Mr  Knightley  she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor  and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for  Emma turned away her head  divided between tears and smiles   It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion  said Mr  Knightley   We should not like her so well as we do  sir  if we could suppose it  but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor  s advantage  she knows how very acceptable it must be  at Miss Taylor  s time of life  to be settled in a home of her own  and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision  and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure  Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married   And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me  said Emma   and a very considerable one  that I made the match myself  I made the match  you know  four years ago  and to have it take place  and be proved in the right  when so many people said Mr  Weston would never marry again  may comfort me for any thing  Mr  Knightley shook his head at her  Her father fondly replied   Ah  my dear  I wish you would not make matches and foretell things  for whatever you say always comes to pass  Pray do not make any more matches   I promise you to make none for myself  papa  but I must  indeed  for other people  It is the greatest amusement in the world  And after such success  you know  Every body said that Mr  Weston would never marry again  Oh dear  no  Mr  Weston  who had been a widower so long  and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife  so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here  always acceptable wherever he went  always cheerful  Mr  Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it  Oh no  Mr  Weston certainly would never marry again  Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed  and others of the son and the uncle not letting him  All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject  but I believed none of it   Ever since the day  about four years ago  that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane  when  because it began to drizzle  he darted away with so much gallantry  and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell  s  I made up my mind on the subject  I planned the match from that hour  and when such success has blessed me in this instance  dear papa  you cannot think that I shall leave off match  making   I do not understand what you mean by ` success  said Mr  Knightley   Success supposes endeavour  Your time has been properly and delicately spent  if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage  A worthy employment for a young lady  s mind  But if  which I rather imagine  your making the match  as you call it  means only your planning it  your saying to yourself one idle day  ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr  Weston were to marry her  and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards  why do you talk of success  Where is your merit  What are you proud of  You made a lucky guess  and _that_ is all that can be said   And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess  I pity you  I thought you cleverer  for  depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck  There is always some talent in it  And as to my poor word ` success  which you quarrel with  I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it  You have drawn two pretty pictures  but I think there may be a third  a something between the do  nothing and the do  all  If I had not promoted Mr  Weston  s visits here  and given many little encouragements  and smoothed many little matters  it might not have come to any thing after all  I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that   A straightforward  open  hearted man like Weston  and a rational  unaffected woman like Miss Taylor  may be safely left to manage their own concerns  You are more likely to have done harm to yourself  than good to them  by interference   Emma never thinks of herself  if she can do good to others  rejoined Mr  Woodhouse  understanding but in part   But  my dear  pray do not make any more matches  they are silly things  and break up one  s family circle grievously   Only one more  papa  only for Mr  Elton  Poor Mr  Elton  You like Mr  Elton  papa  I must look about for a wife for him  There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him  and he has been here a whole year  and has fitted up his house so comfortably  that it would be a shame to have him single any longer  and I thought when he was joining their hands to  day  he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him  I think very well of Mr  Elton  and this is the only way I have of doing him a service   Mr  Elton is a very pretty young man  to be sure  and a very good young man  and I have a great regard for him  But if you want to shew him any attention  my dear  ask him to come and dine with us some day  That will be a much better thing  I dare say Mr  Knightley will be so kind as to meet him   With a great deal of pleasure  sir  at any time  said Mr  Knightley  laughing   and I agree with you entirely  that it will be a much better thing  Invite him to dinner  Emma  and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken  but leave him to chuse his own wife  Depend upon it  a man of six or seven  and  twenty can take care of himself  CHAPTER II Mr  Weston was a native of Highbury  and born of a respectable family  which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property  He had received a good education  but  on succeeding early in life to a small independence  had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged  and had satisfied an active  cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county  then embodied  Captain Weston was a general favourite  and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill  of a great Yorkshire family  and Miss Churchill fell in love with him  nobody was surprized  except her brother and his wife  who had never seen him  and who were full of pride and importance  which the connexion would offend  Miss Churchill  however  being of age  and with the full command of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the family  estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage  and it took place  to the infinite mortification of Mr  and Mrs  Churchill  who threw her off with due decorum  It was an unsuitable connexion  and did not produce much happiness  Mrs  Weston ought to have found more in it  for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him  but though she had one sort of spirit  she had not the best  She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother  but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother  s unreasonable anger  nor from missing the luxuries of her former home  They lived beyond their income  but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe  she did not cease to love her husband  but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston  and Miss Churchill of Enscombe  Captain Weston  who had been considered  especially by the Churchills  as making such an amazing match  was proved to have much the worst of the bargain  for when his wife died  after a three years  marriage  he was rather a poorer man than at first  and with a child to maintain  From the expense of the child  however  he was soon relieved  The boy had  with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother  s  been the means of a sort of reconciliation  and Mr  and Mrs  Churchill  having no children of their own  nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for  offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease  Some scruples and some reluctance the widower  father may be supposed to have felt  but as they were overcome by other considerations  the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills  and he had only his own comfort to seek  and his own situation to improve as he could  A complete change of life became desirable  He quitted the militia and engaged in trade  having brothers already established in a good way in London  which afforded him a favourable opening  It was a concern which brought just employment enough  He had still a small house in Highbury  where most of his leisure days were spent  and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society  the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away  He had  by that time  realised an easy competence  enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury  which he had always longed for  enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor  and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition  It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes  but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth  it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls  and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to  but he had gone steadily on  with these objects in view  till they were accomplished  He had made his fortune  bought his house  and obtained his wife  and was beginning a new period of existence  with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through  He had never been an unhappy man  his own temper had secured him from that  even in his first marriage  but his second must shew him how delightful a well  judging and truly amiable woman could be  and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen  to excite gratitude than to feel it  He had only himself to please in his choice  his fortune was his own  for as to Frank  it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle  s heir  it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age  It was most unlikely  therefore  that he should ever want his father  s assistance  His father had no apprehension of it  The aunt was a capricious woman  and governed her husband entirely  but it was not in Mr  Weston  s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear  and  as he believed  so deservedly dear  He saw his son every year in London  and was proud of him  and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too  He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern  Mr  Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury  and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed  though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life  His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved  Now  upon his father  s marriage  it was very generally proposed  as a most proper attention  that the visit should take place  There was not a dissentient voice on the subject  either when Mrs  Perry drank tea with Mrs  and Miss Bates  or when Mrs  and Miss Bates returned the visit  Now was the time for Mr  Frank Churchill to come among them  and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion  For a few days  every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs  Weston had received   I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr  Frank Churchill has written to Mrs  Weston  I understand it was a very handsome letter  indeed  Mr  Woodhouse told me of it  Mr  Woodhouse saw the letter  and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life  It was  indeed  a highly prized letter  Mrs  Weston had  of course  formed a very favourable idea of the young man  and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense  and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured  She felt herself a most fortunate woman  and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought  where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled  and who could ill bear to part with her  She knew that at times she must be missed  and could not think  without pain  of Emma  s losing a single pleasure  or suffering an hour  s ennui  from the want of her companionableness  but dear Emma was of no feeble character  she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been  and had sense  and energy  and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations  And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield  so convenient for even solitary female walking  and in Mr  Weston  s disposition and circumstances  which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together  Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs  Weston  and of moments only of regret  and her satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment  was so just and so apparent  that Emma  well as she knew her father  was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor  when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort  or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own  But never did she go without Mr  Woodhouse  s giving a gentle sigh  and saying   Ah  poor Miss Taylor  She would be very glad to stay  There was no recovering Miss Taylor  nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her  but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr  Woodhouse  The compliments of his neighbours were over  he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event  and the wedding  cake  which had been a great distress to him  was all eat up  His own stomach could bear nothing rich  and he could never believe other people to be different from himself  What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body  and he had  therefore  earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding  cake at all  and when that proved vain  as earnestly tried to prevent any body  s eating it  He had been at the pains of consulting Mr  Perry  the apothecary  on the subject  Mr  Perry was an intelligent  gentlemanlike man  whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr  Woodhouse  s life  and upon being applied to  he could not but acknowledge  though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination  that wedding  cake might certainly disagree with many  perhaps with most people  unless taken moderately  With such an opinion  in confirmation of his own  Mr  Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair  but still the cake was eaten  and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone  There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs  Weston  s wedding  cake in their hands  but Mr  Woodhouse would never believe it  CHAPTER III Mr  Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way  He liked very much to have his friends come and see him  and from various united causes  from his long residence at Hartfield  and his good nature  from his fortune  his house  and his daughter  he could command the visits of his own little circle  in a great measure  as he liked  He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle  his horror of late hours  and large dinner  parties  made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms  Fortunately for him  Highbury  including Randalls in the same parish  and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining  the seat of Mr  Knightley  comprehended many such  Not unfrequently  through Emma  s persuasion  he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him  but evening parties were what he preferred  and  unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company  there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card  table for him  Real  long  standing regard brought the Westons and Mr  Knightley  and by Mr  Elton  a young man living alone without liking it  the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr  Woodhouse  s drawing  room  and the smiles of his lovely daughter  was in no danger of being thrown away  After these came a second set  among the most come  at  able of whom were Mrs  and Miss Bates  and Mrs  Goddard  three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield  and who were fetched and carried home so often  that Mr  Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses  Had it taken place only once a year  it would have been a grievance  Mrs  Bates  the widow of a former vicar of Highbury  was a very old lady  almost past every thing but tea and quadrille  She lived with her single daughter in a very small way  and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady  under such untoward circumstances  can excite  Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young  handsome  rich  nor married  Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour  and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself  or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect  She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness  Her youth had passed without distinction  and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother  and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible  And yet she was a happy woman  and a woman whom no one named without good  will  It was her own universal good  will and contented temper which worked such wonders  She loved every body  was interested in every body  s happiness  quicksighted to every body  s merits  thought herself a most fortunate creature  and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother  and so many good neighbours and friends  and a home that wanted for nothing  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature  her contented and grateful spirit  were a recommendation to every body  and a mine of felicity to herself  She was a great talker upon little matters  which exactly suited Mr  Woodhouse  full of trivial communications and harmless gossip  Mrs  Goddard was the mistress of a School  not of a seminary  or an establishment  or any thing which professed  in long sentences of refined nonsense  to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality  upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but a real  honest  old  fashioned Boarding  school  where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price  and where girls might be sent to be out of the way  and scramble themselves into a little education  without any danger of coming back prodigies  Mrs  Goddard  s school was in high repute  and very deservedly  for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot  she had an ample house and garden  gave the children plenty of wholesome food  let them run about a great deal in the summer  and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands  It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church  She was a plain  motherly kind of woman  who had worked hard in her youth  and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea  visit  and having formerly owed much to Mr  Woodhouse  s kindness  felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour  hung round with fancy  work  whenever she could  and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside  These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect  and happy was she  for her father  s sake  in the power  though  as far as she was herself concerned  it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs  Weston  She was delighted to see her father look comfortable  and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well  but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated  As she sat one morning  looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day  a note was brought from Mrs  Goddard  requesting  in most respectful terms  to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her  a most welcome request  for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen  whom Emma knew very well by sight  and had long felt an interest in  on account of her beauty  A very gracious invitation was returned  and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion  Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody  Somebody had placed her  several years back  at Mrs  Goddard  s school  and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour  boarder  This was all that was generally known of her history  She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury  and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her  She was a very pretty girl  and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired  She was short  plump  and fair  with a fine bloom  blue eyes  light hair  regular features  and a look of great sweetness  and  before the end of the evening  Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person  and quite determined to continue the acquaintance  She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith  s conversation  but she found her altogether very engaging  not inconveniently shy  not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing  shewing so proper and becoming a deference  seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield  and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to  that she must have good sense  and deserve encouragement  Encouragement should be given  Those soft blue eyes  and all those natural graces  should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions  The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her  The friends from whom she had just parted  though very good sort of people  must be doing her harm  They were a family of the name of Martin  whom Emma well knew by character  as renting a large farm of Mr  Knightley  and residing in the parish of Donwell  very creditably  she believed  she knew Mr  Knightley thought highly of them  but they must be coarse and unpolished  and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect  _She_ would notice her  she would improve her  she would detach her from her bad acquaintance  and introduce her into good society  she would form her opinions and her manners  It would be an interesting  and certainly a very kind undertaking  highly becoming her own situation in life  her leisure  and powers  She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes  in talking and listening  and forming all these schemes in the in  betweens  that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate  and the supper  table  which always closed such parties  and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time  was all set out and ready  and moved forwards to the fire  before she was aware  With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively  with the real good  will of a mind delighted with its own ideas  did she then do all the honours of the meal  and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters  with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests  Upon such occasions poor Mr  Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare  He loved to have the cloth laid  because it had been the fashion of his youth  but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it  and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing  his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat  Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could  with thorough self  approbation  recommend  though he might constrain himself  while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things  to say   Mrs  Bates  let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs  An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome  Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body  I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else  but you need not be afraid  they are very small  you see  one of our small eggs will not hurt you  Miss Bates  let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart  a _very_ little bit  Ours are all apple  tarts  You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here  I do not advise the custard  Mrs  Goddard  what say you to _half_ a glass of wine  A _small_ half  glass  put into a tumbler of water  I do not think it could disagree with you  Emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style  and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy  The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions  Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury  that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure  but the humble  grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings  delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening  and actually shaken hands with her at last  CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith  s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing  Quick and decided in her ways  Emma lost no time in inviting  encouraging  and telling her to come very often  and as their acquaintance increased  so did their satisfaction in each other  As a walking companion  Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her  In that respect Mrs  Weston  s loss had been important  Her father never went beyond the shrubbery  where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk  or his short  as the year varied  and since Mrs  Weston  s marriage her exercise had been too much confined  She had ventured once alone to Randalls  but it was not pleasant  and a Harriet Smith  therefore  one whom she could summon at any time to a walk  would be a valuable addition to her privileges  But in every respect  as she saw more of her  she approved her  and was confirmed in all her kind designs  Harriet certainly was not clever  but she had a sweet  docile  grateful disposition  was totally free from conceit  and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to  Her early attachment to herself was very amiable  and her inclination for good company  and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever  shewed that there was no want of taste  though strength of understanding must not be expected  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith  s being exactly the young friend she wanted  exactly the something which her home required  Such a friend as Mrs  Weston was out of the question  Two such could never be granted  Two such she did not want  It was quite a different sort of thing  a sentiment distinct and independent  Mrs  Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem  Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful  For Mrs  Weston there was nothing to be done  for Harriet every thing  Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents  but Harriet could not tell  She was ready to tell every thing in her power  but on this subject questions were vain  Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked  but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth  Harriet had no penetration  She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs  Goddard chose to tell her  and looked no farther  Mrs  Goddard  and the teachers  and the girls and the affairs of the school in general  formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey  Mill Farm  it must have been the whole  But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal  she had spent two very happy months with them  and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit  and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place  Emma encouraged her talkativeness  amused by such a picture of another set of beings  and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs  Martin  s having  _two_ parlours  two very good parlours  indeed  one of them quite as large as Mrs  Goddard  s drawing  room  and of her having an upper maid who had lived five  and  twenty years with her  and of their having eight cows  two of them Alderneys  and one a little Welch cow  a very pretty little Welch cow indeed  and of Mrs  Martin  s saying as she was so fond of it  it should be called _her_ cow  and of their having a very handsome summer  house in their garden  where some day next year they were all to drink tea  a very handsome summer  house  large enough to hold a dozen people  For some time she was amused  without thinking beyond the immediate cause  but as she came to understand the family better  other feelings arose  She had taken up a wrong idea  fancying it was a mother and daughter  a son and son  s wife  who all lived together  but when it appeared that the Mr  Martin  who bore a part in the narrative  and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good  nature in doing something or other  was a single man  that there was no young Mrs  Martin  no wife in the case  she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness  and that  if she were not taken care of  she might be required to sink herself forever  With this inspiriting notion  her questions increased in number and meaning  and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr  Martin  and there was evidently no dislike to it  Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games  and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good  humoured and obliging  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts  because she had said how fond she was of them  and in every thing else he was so very obliging  He had his shepherd  s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her  She was very fond of singing  He could sing a little himself  She believed he was very clever  and understood every thing  He had a very fine flock  and  while she was with them  he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country  She believed every body spoke well of him  His mother and sisters were very fond of him  Mrs  Martin had told her one day  and there was a blush as she said it  that it was impossible for any body to be a better son  and therefore she was sure  whenever he married  he would make a good husband  Not that she _wanted_ him to marry  She was in no hurry at all   Well done  Mrs  Martin  thought Emma   You know what you are about   And when she had come away  Mrs  Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs  Goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose Mrs  Goddard had ever seen  Mrs  Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday  and asked all the three teachers  Miss Nash  and Miss Prince  and Miss Richardson  to sup with her   Mr  Martin  I suppose  is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business  He does not read   Oh yes  that is  no  I do not know  but I believe he has read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of  He reads the Agricultural Reports  and some other books that lay in one of the window seats  but he reads all _them_ to himself  But sometimes of an evening  before we went to cards  he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts  very entertaining  And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield  He never read the Romance of the Forest  nor The Children of the Abbey  He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them  but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can  The next question was   What sort of looking man is Mr  Martin   Oh  not handsome  not at all handsome  I thought him very plain at first  but I do not think him so plain now  One does not  you know  after a time  But did you never see him  He is in Highbury every now and then  and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston  He has passed you very often   That may be  and I may have seen him fifty times  but without having any idea of his name  A young farmer  whether on horseback or on foot  is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity  The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do  A degree or two lower  and a creditable appearance might interest me  I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other  But a farmer can need none of my help  and is  therefore  in one sense  as much above my notice as in every other he is below it   To be sure  Oh yes  It is not likely you should ever have observed him  but he knows you very well indeed  I mean by sight   I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man  I know  indeed  that he is so  and  as such  wish him well  What do you imagine his age to be   He was four  and  twenty the th of last June  and my birthday is the rd just a fortnight and a day  s difference  which is very odd   Only four  and  twenty  That is too young to settle  His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry  They seem very comfortable as they are  and if she were to take any pains to marry him  she would probably repent it  Six years hence  if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own  with a little money  it might be very desirable   Six years hence  Dear Miss Woodhouse  he would be thirty years old   Well  and that is as early as most men can afford to marry  who are not born to an independence  Mr  Martin  I imagine  has his fortune entirely to make  cannot be at all beforehand with the world  Whatever money he might come into when his father died  whatever his share of the family property  it is  I dare say  all afloat  all employed in his stock  and so forth  and though  with diligence and good luck  he may be rich in time  it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet   To be sure  so it is  But they live very comfortably  They have no indoors man  else they do not want for any thing  and Mrs  Martin talks of taking a boy another year   I wish you may not get into a scrape  Harriet  whenever he does marry  I mean  as to being acquainted with his wife  for though his sisters  from a superior education  are not to be altogether objected to  it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice  The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates  There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman  s daughter  and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power  or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you   Yes  to be sure  I suppose there are  But while I visit at Hartfield  and you are so kind to me  Miss Woodhouse  I am not afraid of what any body can do   You understand the force of influence pretty well  Harriet  but I would have you so firmly established in good society  as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse  I want to see you permanently well connected  and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be  and  therefore  I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr  Martin marries  I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters  to be acquainted with the wife  who will probably be some mere farmer  s daughter  without education   To be sure  Yes  Not that I think Mr  Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education  and been very well brought up  However  I do not mean to set up my opinion against your  s  and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife  I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins  especially Elizabeth  and should be very sorry to give them up  for they are quite as well educated as me  But if he marries a very ignorant  vulgar woman  certainly I had better not visit her  if I can help it  Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech  and saw no alarming symptoms of love  The young man had been the first admirer  but she trusted there was no other hold  and that there would be no serious difficulty  on Harriet  s side  to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own  They met Mr  Martin the very next day  as they were walking on the Donwell road  He was on foot  and after looking very respectfully at her  looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion  Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey  and walking a few yards forward  while they talked together  soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr  Robert Martin  His appearance was very neat  and he looked like a sensible young man  but his person had no other advantage  and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen  she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet  s inclination  Harriet was not insensible of manner  she had voluntarily noticed her father  s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder  Mr  Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was  They remained but a few minutes together  as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting  and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face  and in a flutter of spirits  which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose   Only think of our happening to meet him  How very odd  It was quite a chance  he said  that he had not gone round by Randalls  He did not think we ever walked this road  He thought we walked towards Randalls most days  He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet  He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it  but he goes again to  morrow  So very odd we should happen to meet  Well  Miss Woodhouse  is he like what you expected  What do you think of him  Do you think him so very plain   He is very plain  undoubtedly  remarkably plain  but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility  I had no right to expect much  and I did not expect much  but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish  so totally without air  I had imagined him  I confess  a degree or two nearer gentility   To be sure  said Harriet  in a mortified voice   he is not so genteel as real gentlemen   I think  Harriet  since your acquaintance with us  you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen  that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr  Martin  At Hartfield  you have had very good specimens of well educated  well bred men  I should be surprized if  after seeing them  you could be in company with Mr  Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature  and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before  Do not you begin to feel that now  Were not you struck  I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner  and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here   Certainly  he is not like Mr  Knightley  He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr  Knightley  I see the difference plain enough  But Mr  Knightley is so very fine a man   Mr  Knightley  s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr  Martin with _him_  You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr  Knightley  But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to  What say you to Mr  Weston and Mr  Elton  Compare Mr  Martin with either of _them_  Compare their manner of carrying themselves  of walking  of speaking  of being silent  You must see the difference   Oh yes  there is a great difference  But Mr  Weston is almost an old man  Mr  Weston must be between forty and fifty   Which makes his good manners the more valuable  The older a person grows  Harriet  the more important it is that their manners should not be bad  the more glaring and disgusting any loudness  or coarseness  or awkwardness becomes  What is passable in youth is detestable in later age  Mr  Martin is now awkward and abrupt  what will he be at Mr  Weston  s time of life   There is no saying  indeed  replied Harriet rather solemnly   But there may be pretty good guessing  He will be a completely gross  vulgar farmer  totally inattentive to appearances  and thinking of nothing but profit and loss   Will he  indeed  That will be very bad   How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended  He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else  which is just as it should be  for a thriving man  What has he to do with books  And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive  and be a very rich man in time  and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_   I wonder he did not remember the book  was all Harriet  s answer  and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself  She  therefore  said no more for some time  Her next beginning was   In one respect  perhaps  Mr  Elton  s manners are superior to Mr  Knightley  s or Mr  Weston  s  They have more gentleness  They might be more safely held up as a pattern  There is an openness  a quickness  almost a bluntness in Mr  Weston  which every body likes in _him_  because there is so much good  humour with it  but that would not do to be copied  Neither would Mr  Knightley  s downright  decided  commanding sort of manner  though it suits _him_ very well  his figure  and look  and situation in life seem to allow it  but if any young man were to set about copying him  he would not be sufferable  On the contrary  I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr  Elton as a model  Mr  Elton is good  humoured  cheerful  obliging  and gentle  He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late  I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us  Harriet  by additional softness  but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be  If he means any thing  it must be to please you  Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day  She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr  Elton  and now did full justice to  and Harriet blushed and smiled  and said she had always thought Mr  Elton very agreeable  Mr  Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet  s head  She thought it would be an excellent match  and only too palpably desirable  natural  and probable  for her to have much merit in planning it  She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict  It was not likely  however  that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan  as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet  s coming to Hartfield  The longer she considered it  the greater was her sense of its expediency  Mr  Elton  s situation was most suitable  quite the gentleman himself  and without low connexions  at the same time  not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet  He had a comfortable home for her  and Emma imagined a very sufficient income  for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large  he was known to have some independent property  and she thought very highly of him as a good  humoured  well  meaning  respectable young man  without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world  She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl  which she trusted  with such frequent meetings at Hartfield  was foundation enough on his side  and on Harriet  s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy  And he was really a very pleasing young man  a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like  He was reckoned very handsome  his person much admired in general  though not by her  there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with  but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin  s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr  Elton  s admiration  CHAPTER V  I do not know what your opinion may be  Mrs  Weston  said Mr  Knightley   of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith  but I think it a bad thing   A bad thing  Do you really think it a bad thing  why so   I think they will neither of them do the other any good   You surprize me  Emma must do Harriet good  and by supplying her with a new object of interest  Harriet may be said to do Emma good  I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure  How very differently we feel  Not think they will do each other any good  This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma  Mr  Knightley   Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you  knowing Weston to be out  and that you must still fight your own battle   Mr  Weston would undoubtedly support me  if he were here  for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject  We were speaking of it only yesterday  and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma  that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with  Mr  Knightley  I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case  You are so much used to live alone  that you do not know the value of a companion  and  perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex  after being used to it all her life  I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith  She is not the superior young woman which Emma  s friend ought to be  But on the other hand  as Emma wants to see her better informed  it will be an inducement to her to read more herself  They will read together  She means it  I know   Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing  up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through  and very good lists they were  very well chosen  and very neatly arranged  sometimes alphabetically  and sometimes by some other rule  The list she drew up when only fourteen  I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit  that I preserved it some time  and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now  But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma  She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience  and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding  Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate  I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing  You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished  You know you could not   I dare say  replied Mrs  Weston  smiling   that I thought so _then_  but since we have parted  I can never remember Emma  s omitting to do any thing I wished   There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_  said Mr  Knightley  feelingly  and for a moment or two he had done   But I  he soon added   who have had no such charm thrown over my senses  must still see  hear  and remember  Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family  At ten years old  she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen  She was always quick and assured  Isabella slow and diffident  And ever since she was twelve  Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all  In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her  She inherits her mother  s talents  and must have been under subjection to her   I should have been sorry  Mr  Knightley  to be dependent on _your_ recommendation  had I quitted Mr  Woodhouse  s family and wanted another situation  I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held   Yes  said he  smiling   You are better placed _here_  very fit for a wife  but not at all for a governess  But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield  You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise  but you were receiving a very good education from _her_  on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will  and doing as you were bid  and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife  I should certainly have named Miss Taylor   Thank you  There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr  Weston   Why  to own the truth  I am afraid you are rather thrown away  and that with every disposition to bear  there will be nothing to be borne  We will not despair  however  Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort  or his son may plague him   I hope not _that_  It is not likely  No  Mr  Knightley  do not foretell vexation from that quarter   Not I  indeed  I only name possibilities  I do not pretend to Emma  s genius for foretelling and guessing  I hope  with all my heart  the young man may be a Weston in merit  and a Churchill in fortune  But Harriet Smith  I have not half done about Harriet Smith  I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have  She knows nothing herself  and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing  She is a flatterer in all her ways  and so much the worse  because undesigned  Her ignorance is hourly flattery  How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself  while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority  And as for Harriet  I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance  Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to  She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home  I am much mistaken if Emma  s doctrines give any strength of mind  or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life  They only give a little polish   I either depend more upon Emma  s good sense than you do  or am more anxious for her present comfort  for I cannot lament the acquaintance  How well she looked last night   Oh  you would rather talk of her person than her mind  would you  Very well  I shall not attempt to deny Emma  s being pretty   Pretty  say beautiful rather  Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether  face and figure   I do not know what I could imagine  but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers  But I am a partial old friend   Such an eye  the true hazle eye  and so brilliant  regular features  open countenance  with a complexion  oh  what a bloom of full health  and such a pretty height and size  such a firm and upright figure  There is health  not merely in her bloom  but in her air  her head  her glance  One hears sometimes of a child being ` the picture of health  now  Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown  up health  She is loveliness itself  Mr  Knightley  is not she   I have not a fault to find with her person  he replied   I think her all you describe  I love to look at her  and I will add this praise  that I do not think her personally vain  Considering how very handsome she is  she appears to be little occupied with it  her vanity lies another way  Mrs  Weston  I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith  or my dread of its doing them both harm   And I  Mr  Knightley  am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm  With all dear Emma  s little faults  she is an excellent creature  Where shall we see a better daughter  or a kinder sister  or a truer friend  No  no  she has qualities which may be trusted  she will never lead any one really wrong  she will make no lasting blunder  where Emma errs once  she is in the right a hundred times   Very well  I will not plague you any more  Emma shall be an angel  and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella  John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection  and Isabella always thinks as he does  except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children  I am sure of having their opinions with me   I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind  but excuse me  Mr  Knightley  if I take the liberty  I consider myself  you know  as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma  s mother might have had  the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith  s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you  Pray excuse me  but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy  it cannot be expected that Emma  accountable to nobody but her father  who perfectly approves the acquaintance  should put an end to it  so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself  It has been so many years my province to give advice  that you cannot be surprized  Mr  Knightley  at this little remains of office   Not at all  cried he   I am much obliged to you for it  It is very good advice  and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found  for it shall be attended to   Mrs  John Knightley is easily alarmed  and might be made unhappy about her sister   Be satisfied  said he   I will not raise any outcry  I will keep my ill  humour to myself  I have a very sincere interest in Emma  Isabella does not seem more my sister  has never excited a greater interest  perhaps hardly so great  There is an anxiety  a curiosity in what one feels for Emma  I wonder what will become of her   So do I  said Mrs  Weston gently   very much   She always declares she will never marry  which  of course  means just nothing at all  But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for  It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object  I should like to see Emma in love  and in some doubt of a return  it would do her good  But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her  and she goes so seldom from home   There does  indeed  seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present  said Mrs  Weston   as can well be  and while she is so happy at Hartfield  I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr  Woodhouse  s account  I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma  though I mean no slight to the state  I assure you  Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr  Weston  s on the subject  as much as possible  There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma  s destiny  but it was not desirable to have them suspected  and the quiet transition which Mr  Knightley soon afterwards made to  What does Weston think of the weather  shall we have rain  convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield  CHAPTER VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet  s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose  for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr  Elton  s being a remarkably handsome man  with most agreeable manners  and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints  she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet  s side  as there could be any occasion for  She was quite convinced of Mr  Elton  s being in the fairest way of falling in love  if not in love already  She had no scruple with regard to him  He talked of Harriet  and praised her so warmly  that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add  His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet  s manner  since her introduction at Hartfield  was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment   You have given Miss Smith all that she required  said he   you have made her graceful and easy  She was a beautiful creature when she came to you  but  in my opinion  the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature   I am glad you think I have been useful to her  but Harriet only wanted drawing out  and receiving a few  very few hints  She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself  I have done very little   If it were admissible to contradict a lady  said the gallant Mr  Elton   I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character  have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before   Exactly so  that is what principally strikes me  So much superadded decision of character  Skilful has been the hand   Great has been the pleasure  I am sure  I never met with a disposition more truly amiable   I have no doubt of it  And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation  which had a vast deal of the lover  She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers  to have Harriet  s picture   Did you ever have your likeness taken  Harriet  said she   did you ever sit for your picture  Harriet was on the point of leaving the room  and only stopt to say  with a very interesting naivete   Oh  dear  no  never  No sooner was she out of sight  than Emma exclaimed   What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be  I would give any money for it  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself  You do not know it I dare say  but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses  and attempted several of my friends  and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general  But from one cause or another  I gave it up in disgust  But really  I could almost venture  if Harriet would sit to me  It would be such a delight to have her picture   Let me entreat you  cried Mr  Elton   it would indeed be a delight  Let me entreat you  Miss Woodhouse  to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend  I know what your drawings are  How could you suppose me ignorant  Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers  and has not Mrs  Weston some inimitable figure  pieces in her drawing  room  at Randalls  Yes  good man  thought Emma  but what has all that to do with taking likenesses  You know nothing of drawing  Don  t pretend to be in raptures about mine  Keep your raptures for Harriet  s face   Well  if you give me such kind encouragement  Mr  Elton  I believe I shall try what I can do  Harriet  s features are very delicate  which makes a likeness difficult  and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch   Exactly so  The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth  I have not a doubt of your success  Pray  pray attempt it  As you will do it  it will indeed  to use your own words  be an exquisite possession   But I am afraid  Mr  Elton  Harriet will not like to sit  She thinks so little of her own beauty  Did not you observe her manner of answering me  How completely it meant  ` why should my picture be drawn   Oh  yes  I observed it  I assure you  It was not lost on me  But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded  Harriet was soon back again  and the proposal almost immediately made  and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others  Emma wished to go to work directly  and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits  for not one of them had ever been finished  that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet  Her many beginnings were displayed  Miniatures  half  lengths  whole  lengths  pencil  crayon  and water  colours had been all tried in turn  She had always wanted to do every thing  and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to  She played and sang  and drew in almost every style  but steadiness had always been wanting  and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command  and ought not to have failed of  She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician  but she was not unwilling to have others deceived  or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved  There was merit in every drawing  in the least finished  perhaps the most  her style was spirited  but had there been much less  or had there been ten times more  the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same  They were both in ecstasies  A likeness pleases every body  and Miss Woodhouse  s performances must be capital   No great variety of faces for you  said Emma   I had only my own family to study from  There is my father  another of my father  but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous  that I could only take him by stealth  neither of them very like therefore  Mrs  Weston again  and again  and again  you see  Dear Mrs  Weston  always my kindest friend on every occasion  She would sit whenever I asked her  There is my sister  and really quite her own little elegant figure  and the face not unlike  I should have made a good likeness of her  if she would have sat longer  but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet  Then  here come all my attempts at three of those four children  there they are  Henry and John and Bella  from one end of the sheet to the other  and any one of them might do for any one of the rest  She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse  but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know  nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them  beyond the air and complexion  unless they are coarser featured than any of mama  s children ever were  Here is my sketch of the fourth  who was a baby  I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa  and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see  He had nestled down his head most conveniently  That  s very like  I am rather proud of little George  The corner of the sofa is very good  Then here is my last  unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size  whole  length  my last and my best  my brother  Mr  John Knightley  This did not want much of being finished  when I put it away in a pet  and vowed I would never take another likeness  I could not help being provoked  for after all my pains  and when I had really made a very good likeness of it  Mrs  Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like  only too handsome  too flattering  but that was a fault on the right side  after all this  came poor dear Isabella  s cold approbation of  Yes  it was a little like  but to be sure it did not do him justice  We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all  It was made a great favour of  and altogether it was more than I could bear  and so I never would finish it  to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness  to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square  and  as I said  I did then forswear ever drawing any body again  But for Harriet  s sake  or rather for my own  and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_  I will break my resolution now  Mr  Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea  and was repeating   No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed  as you observe  Exactly so  No husbands and wives  with so interesting a consciousness  that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once  But as she wanted to be drawing  the declaration must wait a little longer  She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait  It was to be a whole  length in water  colours  like Mr  John Knightley  s  and was destined  if she could please herself  to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece  The sitting began  and Harriet  smiling and blushing  and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance  presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist  But there was no doing any thing  with Mr  Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch  She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence  but was really obliged to put an end to it  and request him to place himself elsewhere  It then occurred to her to employ him in reading   If he would be so good as to read to them  it would be a kindness indeed  It would amuse away the difficulties of her part  and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith  s  Mr  Elton was only too happy  Harriet listened  and Emma drew in peace  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look  any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover  and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil  to jump up and see the progress  and be charmed  There was no being displeased with such an encourager  for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible  She could not respect his eye  but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable  The sitting was altogether very satisfactory  she was quite enough pleased with the first day  s sketch to wish to go on  There was no want of likeness  she had been fortunate in the attitude  and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure  to give a little more height  and considerably more elegance  she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last  and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both  a standing memorial of the beauty of one  the skill of the other  and the friendship of both  with as many other agreeable associations as Mr  Elton  s very promising attachment was likely to add  Harriet was to sit again the next day  and Mr  Elton  just as he ought  entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again   By all means  We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party  The same civilities and courtesies  the same success and satisfaction  took place on the morrow  and accompanied the whole progress of the picture  which was rapid and happy  Every body who saw it was pleased  but Mr  Elton was in continual raptures  and defended it through every criticism   Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted  observed Mrs  Weston to him  not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover  The expression of the eye is most correct  but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes  It is the fault of her face that she has them not   Do you think so  replied he   I cannot agree with you  It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature  I never saw such a likeness in my life  We must allow for the effect of shade  you know   You have made her too tall  Emma  said Mr  Knightley  Emma knew that she had  but would not own it  and Mr  Elton warmly added   Oh no  certainly not too tall  not in the least too tall  Consider  she is sitting down  which naturally presents a different  which in short gives exactly the idea  and the proportions must be preserved  you know  Proportions  fore  shortening  Oh no  it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith  s  Exactly so indeed   It is very pretty  said Mr  Woodhouse   So prettily done  Just as your drawings always are  my dear  I do not know any body who draws so well as you do  The only thing I do not thoroughly like is  that she seems to be sitting out of doors  with only a little shawl over her shoulders  and it makes one think she must catch cold   But  my dear papa  it is supposed to be summer  a warm day in summer  Look at the tree   But it is never safe to sit out of doors  my dear   You  sir  may say any thing  cried Mr  Elton   but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought  the placing of Miss Smith out of doors  and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit  Any other situation would have been much less in character  The naivete of Miss Smith  s manners  and altogether  Oh  it is most admirable  I cannot keep my eyes from it  I never saw such a likeness  The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed  and here were a few difficulties  It must be done directly  it must be done in London  the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on  and Isabella  the usual doer of all commissions  must not be applied to  because it was December  and Mr  Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr  Elton  than it was removed  His gallantry was always on the alert   Might he be trusted with the commission  what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it  he could ride to London at any time  It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand   He was too good  she could not endure the thought  she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world  brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances  and a very few minutes settled the business  Mr  Elton was to take the drawing to London  chuse the frame  and give the directions  and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him  while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough   What a precious deposit  said he with a tender sigh  as he received it   This man is almost too gallant to be in love  thought Emma   I should say so  but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love  He is an excellent young man  and will suit Harriet exactly  it will be an ` Exactly so  as he says himself  but he does sigh and languish  and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal  I come in for a pretty good share as a second  But it is his gratitude on Harriet  s account  CHAPTER VII The very day of Mr  Elton  s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma  s services towards her friend  Harriet had been at Hartfield  as usual  soon after breakfast  and  after a time  had gone home to return again to dinner  she returned  and sooner than had been talked of  and with an agitated  hurried look  announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell  Half a minute brought it all out  She had heard  as soon as she got back to Mrs  Goddard  s  that Mr  Martin had been there an hour before  and finding she was not at home  nor particularly expected  had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters  and gone away  and on opening this parcel  she had actually found  besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy  a letter to herself  and this letter was from him  from Mr  Martin  and contained a direct proposal of marriage   Who could have thought it  She was so surprized she did not know what to do  Yes  quite a proposal of marriage  and a very good letter  at least she thought so  And he wrote as if he really loved her very much  but she did not know  and so  she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do  Emma was half  ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful   Upon my word  she cried   the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking  He will connect himself well if he can   Will you read the letter  cried Harriet   Pray do  I  d rather you would  Emma was not sorry to be pressed  She read  and was surprized  The style of the letter was much above her expectation  There were not merely no grammatical errors  but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman  the language  though plain  was strong and unaffected  and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer  It was short  but expressed good sense  warm attachment  liberality  propriety  even delicacy of feeling  She paused over it  while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion  with a  Well  well  and was at last forced to add   Is it a good letter  or is it too short   Yes  indeed  a very good letter  replied Emma rather slowly  so good a letter  Harriet  that every thing considered  I think one of his sisters must have helped him  I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well  if left quite to his own powers  and yet it is not the style of a woman  no  certainly  it is too strong and concise  not diffuse enough for a woman  No doubt he is a sensible man  and I suppose may have a natural talent for  thinks strongly and clearly  and when he takes a pen in hand  his thoughts naturally find proper words  It is so with some men  Yes  I understand the sort of mind  Vigorous  decided  with sentiments to a certain point  not coarse  A better written letter  Harriet  returning it  than I had expected   Well  said the still waiting Harriet  well  and  and what shall I do   What shall you do  In what respect  Do you mean with regard to this letter   Yes   But what are you in doubt of  You must answer it of course  and speedily   Yes  But what shall I say  Dear Miss Woodhouse  do advise me   Oh no  no  the letter had much better be all your own  You will express yourself very properly  I am sure  There is no danger of your not being intelligible  which is the first thing  Your meaning must be unequivocal  no doubts or demurs  and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires  will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind  I am persuaded  You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment   You think I ought to refuse him then  said Harriet  looking down   Ought to refuse him  My dear Harriet  what do you mean  Are you in any doubt as to that  I thought  but I beg your pardon  perhaps I have been under a mistake  I certainly have been misunderstanding you  if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer  I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it  Harriet was silent  With a little reserve of manner  Emma continued   You mean to return a favourable answer  I collect   No  I do not  that is  I do not mean  What shall I do  What would you advise me to do  Pray  dear Miss Woodhouse  tell me what I ought to do   I shall not give you any advice  Harriet  I will have nothing to do with it  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings   I had no notion that he liked me so very much  said Harriet  contemplating the letter  For a little while Emma persevered in her silence  but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful  she thought it best to say   I lay it down as a general rule  Harriet  that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not  she certainly ought to refuse him  If she can hesitate as to ` Yes  she ought to say ` No  directly  It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings  with half a heart  I thought it my duty as a friend  and older than yourself  to say thus much to you  But do not imagine that I want to influence you   Oh  no  I am sure you are a great deal too kind to  but if you would just advise me what I had best do  No  no  I do not mean that  As you say  one  s mind ought to be quite made up  One should not be hesitating  It is a very serious thing  It will be safer to say ` No  perhaps  Do you think I had better say ` No   Not for the world  said Emma  smiling graciously   would I advise you either way  You must be the best judge of your own happiness  If you prefer Mr  Martin to every other person  if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with  why should you hesitate  You blush  Harriet  Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition  Harriet  Harriet  do not deceive yourself  do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion  At this moment whom are you thinking of  The symptoms were favourable  Instead of answering  Harriet turned away confused  and stood thoughtfully by the fire  and though the letter was still in her hand  it was now mechanically twisted about without regard  Emma waited the result with impatience  but not without strong hopes  At last  with some hesitation  Harriet said   Miss Woodhouse  as you will not give me your opinion  I must do as well as I can by myself  and I have now quite determined  and really almost made up my mind  to refuse Mr  Martin  Do you think I am right   Perfectly  perfectly right  my dearest Harriet  you are doing just what you ought  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself  but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving  Dear Harriet  I give myself joy of this  It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance  which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr  Martin  While you were in the smallest degree wavering  I said nothing about it  because I would not influence  but it would have been the loss of a friend to me  I could not have visited Mrs  Robert Martin  of Abbey  Mill Farm  Now I am secure of you for ever  Harriet had not surmised her own danger  but the idea of it struck her forcibly   You could not have visited me  she cried  looking aghast   No  to be sure you could not  but I never thought of that before  That would have been too dreadful  What an escape  Dear Miss Woodhouse  I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world   Indeed  Harriet  it would have been a severe pang to lose you  but it must have been  You would have thrown yourself out of all good society  I must have given you up   Dear me  How should I ever have borne it  It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more   Dear affectionate creature  _You_ banished to Abbey  Mill Farm  _You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life  I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it  He must have a pretty good opinion of himself   I do not think he is conceited either  in general  said Harriet  her conscience opposing such censure   at least  he is very good natured  and I shall always feel much obliged to him  and have a great regard for  but that is quite a different thing from  and you know  though he may like me  it does not follow that I should  and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people  and if one comes to compare them  person and manners  there is no comparison at all  _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable  However  I do really think Mr  Martin a very amiable young man  and have a great opinion of him  and his being so much attached to me  and his writing such a letter  but as to leaving you  it is what I would not do upon any consideration   Thank you  thank you  my own sweet little friend  We will not be parted  A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked  or because he is attached to her  and can write a tolerable letter   Oh no  and it is but a short letter too  Emma felt the bad taste of her friend  but let it pass with a  very true  and it would be a small consolation to her  for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day  to know that her husband could write a good letter   Oh  yes  very  Nobody cares for a letter  the thing is  to be always happy with pleasant companions  I am quite determined to refuse him  But how shall I do  What shall I say  Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer  and advised its being written directly  which was agreed to  in the hope of her assistance  and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted  it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence  The looking over his letter again  in replying to it  had such a softening tendency  that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions  and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy  and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say  and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful  that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment  he would have been accepted after all  This letter  however  was written  and sealed  and sent  The business was finished  and Harriet safe  She was rather low all the evening  but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets  and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection  sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr  Elton   I shall never be invited to Abbey  Mill again  was said in rather a sorrowful tone   Nor  if you were  could I ever bear to part with you  my Harriet  You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey  Mill   And I am sure I should never want to go there  for I am never happy but at Hartfield  Some time afterwards it was   I think Mrs  Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened  I am sure Miss Nash would  for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married  and it is only a linen  draper   One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school  Harriet  I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married  Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes  As to any thing superior for you  I suppose she is quite in the dark  The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle  tattle of Highbury yet  Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves  Harriet blushed and smiled  and said something about wondering that people should like her so much  The idea of Mr  Elton was certainly cheering  but still  after a time  she was tender  hearted again towards the rejected Mr  Martin   Now he has got my letter  said she softly   I wonder what they are all doing  whether his sisters know  if he is unhappy  they will be unhappy too  I hope he will not mind it so very much   Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed  cried Emma   At this moment  perhaps  Mr  Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters  telling how much more beautiful is the original  and after being asked for it five or six times  allowing them to hear your name  your own dear name   My picture  But he has left my picture in Bond  street   Has he so  Then I know nothing of Mr  Elton  No  my dear little modest Harriet  depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond  street till just before he mounts his horse to  morrow  It is his companion all this evening  his solace  his delight  It opens his designs to his family  it introduces you among them  it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature  eager curiosity and warm prepossession  How cheerful  how animated  how suspicious  how busy their imaginations all are  Harriet smiled again  and her smiles grew stronger  CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night  For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there  and gradually getting to have a bed  room appropriated to herself  and Emma judged it best in every respect  safest and kindest  to keep her with them as much as possible just at present  She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs  Goddard  s  but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield  to make a regular visit of some days  While she was gone  Mr  Knightley called  and sat some time with Mr  Woodhouse and Emma  till Mr  Woodhouse  who had previously made up his mind to walk out  was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it  and was induced by the entreaties of both  though against the scruples of his own civility  to leave Mr  Knightley for that purpose  Mr  Knightley  who had nothing of ceremony about him  was offering by his short  decided answers  an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other   Well  I believe  if you will excuse me  Mr  Knightley  if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing  I shall take Emma  s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour  As the sun is out  I believe I had better take my three turns while I can  I treat you without ceremony  Mr  Knightley  We invalids think we are privileged people   My dear sir  do not make a stranger of me   I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter  Emma will be happy to entertain you  And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns  my winter walk   You cannot do better  sir   I would ask for the pleasure of your company  Mr  Knightley  but I am a very slow walker  and my pace would be tedious to you  and  besides  you have another long walk before you  to Donwell Abbey   Thank you  sir  thank you  I am going this moment myself  and I think the sooner _you_ go the better  I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you  Mr  Woodhouse at last was off  but Mr  Knightley  instead of being immediately off likewise  sat down again  seemingly inclined for more chat  He began speaking of Harriet  and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before   I cannot rate her beauty as you do  said he   but she is a pretty little creature  and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition  Her character depends upon those she is with  but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman   I am glad you think so  and the good hands  I hope  may not be wanting   Come  said he   you are anxious for a compliment  so I will tell you that you have improved her  You have cured her of her school  girl  s giggle  she really does you credit   Thank you  I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use  but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may  _You_ do not often overpower me with it   You are expecting her again  you say  this morning   Almost every moment  She has been gone longer already than she intended   Something has happened to delay her  some visitors perhaps   Highbury gossips  Tiresome wretches   Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would  Emma knew this was too true for contradiction  and therefore said nothing  He presently added  with a smile   I do not pretend to fix on times or places  but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage   Indeed  how so  of what sort   A very serious sort  I assure you  still smiling   Very serious  I can think of but one thing  Who is in love with her  Who makes you their confidant  Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr  Elton  s having dropt a hint  Mr  Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser  and she knew Mr  Elton looked up to him   I have reason to think  he replied   that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage  and from a most unexceptionable quarter  Robert Martin is the man  Her visit to Abbey  Mill  this summer  seems to have done his business  He is desperately in love and means to marry her   He is very obliging  said Emma   but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him   Well  well  means to make her an offer then  Will that do  He came to the Abbey two evenings ago  on purpose to consult me about it  He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family  and  I believe  considers me as one of his best friends  He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early  whether I thought her too young  in short  whether I approved his choice altogether  having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered  especially since _your_ making so much of her  as in a line of society above him  I was very much pleased with all that he said  I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin  He always speaks to the purpose  open  straightforward  and very well judging  He told me every thing  his circumstances and plans  and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage  He is an excellent young man  both as son and brother  I had no hesitation in advising him to marry  He proved to me that he could afford it  and that being the case  I was convinced he could not do better  I praised the fair lady too  and altogether sent him away very happy  If he had never esteemed my opinion before  he would have thought highly of me then  and  I dare say  left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had  This happened the night before last  Now  as we may fairly suppose  he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady  and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday  it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs  Goddard  s to  day  and she may be detained by a visitor  without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch   Pray  Mr  Knightley  said Emma  who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech   how do you know that Mr  Martin did not speak yesterday   Certainly  replied he  surprized   I do not absolutely know it  but it may be inferred  Was not she the whole day with you   Come  said she   I will tell you something  in return for what you have told me  He did speak yesterday  that is  he wrote  and was refused  This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed  and Mr  Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure  as he stood up  in tall indignation  and said   Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her  What is the foolish girl about   Oh  to be sure  cried Emma   it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage  A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her   Nonsense  a man does not imagine any such thing  But what is the meaning of this  Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin  madness  if it is so  but I hope you are mistaken   I saw her answer  nothing could be clearer   You saw her answer  you wrote her answer too  Emma  this is your doing  You persuaded her to refuse him   And if I did   which  however  I am far from allowing  I should not feel that I had done wrong  Mr  Martin is a very respectable young man  but I cannot admit him to be Harriet  s equal  and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her  By your account  he does seem to have had some scruples  It is a pity that they were ever got over   Not Harriet  s equal  exclaimed Mr  Knightley loudly and warmly  and with calmer asperity  added  a few moments afterwards   No  he is not her equal indeed  for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation  Emma  your infatuation about that girl blinds you  What are Harriet Smith  s claims  either of birth  nature or education  to any connexion higher than Robert Martin  She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom  with probably no settled provision at all  and certainly no respectable relations  She is known only as parlour  boarder at a common school  She is not a sensible girl  nor a girl of any information  She has been taught nothing useful  and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself  At her age she can have no experience  and with her little wit  is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her  She is pretty  and she is good tempered  and that is all  My only scruple in advising the match was on his account  as being beneath his deserts  and a bad connexion for him  I felt that  as to fortune  in all probability he might do much better  and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate  he could not do worse  But I could not reason so to a man in love  and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her  to her having that sort of disposition  which  in good hands  like his  might be easily led aright and turn out very well  The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side  and had not the smallest doubt  nor have I now  that there would be a general cry  out upon her extreme good luck  Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of  It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend  s leaving Highbury  for the sake of her being settled so well  I remember saying to myself  ` Even Emma  with all her partiality for Harriet  will think this a good match   I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing  What  think a farmer   and with all his sense and all his merit Mr  Martin is nothing more  a good match for my intimate friend  Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own  I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings  I assure you mine are very different  I must think your statement by no means fair  You are not just to Harriet  s claims  They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself  Mr  Martin may be the richest of the two  but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society  The sphere in which she moves is much above his  It would be a degradation   A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance  to be married to a respectable  intelligent gentleman  farmer   As to the circumstances of her birth  though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody  it will not hold in common sense  She is not to pay for the offence of others  by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up  There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman  and a gentleman of fortune  Her allowance is very liberal  nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort  That she is a gentleman  s daughter  is indubitable to me  that she associates with gentlemen  s daughters  no one  I apprehend  will deny  She is superior to Mr  Robert Martin   Whoever might be her parents  said Mr  Knightley   whoever may have had the charge of her  it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society  After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs  Goddard  s hands to shift as she can  to move  in short  in Mrs  Goddard  s line  to have Mrs  Goddard  s acquaintance  Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her  and it _was_ good enough  She desired nothing better herself  Till you chose to turn her into a friend  her mind had no distaste for her own set  nor any ambition beyond it  She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer  She had no sense of superiority then  If she has it now  you have given it  You have been no friend to Harriet Smith  Emma  Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far  if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him  I know him well  He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion  And as to conceit  he is the farthest from it of any man I know  Depend upon it he had encouragement  It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion  she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again   You are a very warm friend to Mr  Martin  but  as I said before  are unjust to Harriet  Harriet  s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them  She is not a clever girl  but she has better sense than you are aware of  and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly  Waiving that point  however  and supposing her to be  as you describe her  only pretty and good  natured  let me tell you  that in the degree she possesses them  they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general  for she is  in fact  a beautiful girl  and must be thought so by ninety  nine people out of an hundred  and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed  till they do fall in love with well  informed minds instead of handsome faces  a girl  with such loveliness as Harriet  has a certainty of being admired and sought after  of having the power of chusing from among many  consequently a claim to be nice  Her good  nature  too  is not so very slight a claim  comprehending  as it does  real  thorough sweetness of temper and manner  a very humble opinion of herself  and a great readiness to be pleased with other people  I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty  and such temper  the highest claims a woman could possess   Upon my word  Emma  to hear you abusing the reason you have  is almost enough to make me think so too  Better be without sense  than misapply it as you do   To be sure  cried she playfully   I know _that_ is the feeling of you all  I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in  what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment  Oh  Harriet may pick and chuse  Were you  yourself  ever to marry  she is the very woman for you  And is she  at seventeen  just entering into life  just beginning to be known  to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives  No  pray let her have time to look about her   I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy  said Mr  Knightley presently   though I have kept my thoughts to myself  but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet  You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty  and of what she has a claim to  that  in a little while  nobody within her reach will be good enough for her  Vanity working on a weak head  produces every sort of mischief  Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high  Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast  though she is a very pretty girl  Men of sense  whatever you may chuse to say  do not want silly wives  Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity  and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in  when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed  Let her marry Robert Martin  and she is safe  respectable  and happy for ever  but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly  and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune  she may be a parlour  boarder at Mrs  Goddard  s all the rest of her life  or  at least   for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other  till she grow desperate  and is glad to catch at the old writing  master  s son   We think so very differently on this point  Mr  Knightley  that there can be no use in canvassing it  We shall only be making each other more angry  But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin  it is impossible  she has refused him  and so decidedly  I think  as must prevent any second application  She must abide by the evil of having refused him  whatever it may be  and as to the refusal itself  I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little  but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do  His appearance is so much against him  and his manner so bad  that if she ever were disposed to favour him  she is not now  I can imagine  that before she had seen any body superior  she might tolerate him  He was the brother of her friends  and he took pains to please her  and altogether  having seen nobody better  that must have been his great assistant  she might not  while she was at Abbey  Mill  find him disagreeable  But the case is altered now  She knows now what gentlemen are  and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet   Nonsense  errant nonsense  as ever was talked  cried Mr  Knightley  Robert Martin  s manners have sense  sincerity  and good  humour to recommend them  and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand  Emma made no answer  and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned  but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone  She did not repent what she had done  she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be  but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general  which made her dislike having it so loudly against her  and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state  was very disagreeable  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence  with only one attempt on Emma  s side to talk of the weather  but he made no answer  He was thinking  The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words   Robert Martin has no great loss  if he can but think so  and I hope it will not be long before he does  Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself  but as you make no secret of your love of match  making  it is fair to suppose that views  and plans  and projects you have  and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man  I think it will be all labour in vain  Emma laughed and disclaimed  He continued   Depend upon it  Elton will not do  Elton is a very good sort of man  and a very respectable vicar of Highbury  but not at all likely to make an imprudent match  He knows the value of a good income as well as any body  Elton may talk sentimentally  but he will act rationally  He is as well acquainted with his own claims  as you can be with Harriet  s  He knows that he is a very handsome young man  and a great favourite wherever he goes  and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments  when there are only men present  I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away  I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with  who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece   I am very much obliged to you  said Emma  laughing again   If I had set my heart on Mr  Elton  s marrying Harriet  it would have been very kind to open my eyes  but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself  I have done with match  making indeed  I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls  I shall leave off while I am well   Good morning to you  said he  rising and walking off abruptly  He was very much vexed  He felt the disappointment of the young man  and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it  by the sanction he had given  and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair  was provoking him exceedingly  Emma remained in a state of vexation too  but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her  s  than in his  She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself  so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary  s wrong  as Mr  Knightley  He walked off in more complete self  approbation than he left for her  She was not so materially cast down  however  but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives  Harriet  s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy  The possibility of the young man  s coming to Mrs  Goddard  s that morning  and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause  gave alarming ideas  The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness  and when Harriet appeared  and in very good spirits  and without having any such reason to give for her long absence  she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind  and convinced her  that let Mr  Knightley think or say what he would  she had done nothing which woman  s friendship and woman  s feelings would not justify  He had frightened her a little about Mr  Elton  but when she considered that Mr  Knightley could not have observed him as she had done  neither with the interest  nor  she must be allowed to tell herself  in spite of Mr  Knightley  s pretensions  with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself  that he had spoken it hastily and in anger  she was able to believe  that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true  than what he knew any thing about  He certainly might have heard Mr  Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done  and Mr  Elton might not be of an imprudent  inconsiderate disposition as to money matters  he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them  but then  Mr  Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives  Mr  Knightley saw no such passion  and of course thought nothing of its effects  but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest  and more than a reasonable  becoming degree of prudence  she was very sure did not belong to Mr  Elton  Harriet  s cheerful look and manner established hers  she came back  not to think of Mr  Martin  but to talk of Mr  Elton  Miss Nash had been telling her something  which she repeated immediately with great delight  Mr  Perry had been to Mrs  Goddard  s to attend a sick child  and Miss Nash had seen him  and he had told Miss Nash  that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park  he had met Mr  Elton  and found to his great surprize  that Mr  Elton was actually on his road to London  and not meaning to return till the morrow  though it was the whist  club night  which he had been never known to miss before  and Mr  Perry had remonstrated with him about it  and told him how shabby it was in him  their best player  to absent himself  and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day  but it would not do  Mr  Elton had been determined to go on  and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed  that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world  and something about a very enviable commission  and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious  Mr  Perry could not quite understand him  but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case  and he told him so  and Mr  Elton only looked very conscious and smiling  and rode off in great spirits  Miss Nash had told her all this  and had talked a great deal more about Mr  Elton  and said  looking so very significantly at her   that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be  but she only knew that any woman whom Mr  Elton could prefer  she should think the luckiest woman in the world  for  beyond a doubt  Mr  Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness  CHAPTER IX Mr  Knightley might quarrel with her  but Emma could not quarrel with herself  He was so much displeased  that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again  and when they did meet  his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven  She was sorry  but could not repent  On the contrary  her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days  The Picture  elegantly framed  came safely to hand soon after Mr  Elton  s return  and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting  room  he got up to look at it  and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought  and as for Harriet  s feelings  they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted  Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr  Martin  s being no otherwise remembered  than as he furnished a contrast with Mr  Elton  of the utmost advantage to the latter  Her views of improving her little friend  s mind  by a great deal of useful reading and conversation  had never yet led to more than a few first chapters  and the intention of going on to  morrow  It was much easier to chat than to study  much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet  s fortune  than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts  and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present  the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life  was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with  into a thin quarto of hot  pressed paper  made up by her friend  and ornamented with ciphers and trophies  In this age of literature  such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon  Miss Nash  head  teacher at Mrs  Goddard  s  had written out at least three hundred  and Harriet  who had taken the first hint of it from her  hoped  with Miss Woodhouse  s help  to get a great many more  Emma assisted with her invention  memory and taste  and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand  it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order  in form as well as quantity  Mr  Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls  and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in   So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young  he wondered he could not remember them  but he hoped he should in time  And it always ended in  Kitty  a fair but frozen maid  His good friend Perry  too  whom he had spoken to on the subject  did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind  but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch  and as he went about so much  something  he thought  might come from that quarter  It was by no means his daughter  s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition  Mr  Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked  He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas  charades  or conundrums that he might recollect  and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections  and at the same time  as she could perceive  most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant  nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles  and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled  and rather sentimentally recited  that well  known charade  My first doth affliction denote  Which my second is destin  d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal  made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already   Why will not you write one yourself for us  Mr  Elton  said she   that is the only security for its freshness  and nothing could be easier to you   Oh no  he had never written  hardly ever  any thing of the kind in his life  The stupidest fellow  He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse  he stopt a moment  or Miss Smith could inspire him  The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration  He called for a few moments  just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing  as he said  a charade  which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady  the object of his admiration  but which  from his manner  Emma was immediately convinced must be his own   I do not offer it for Miss Smith  s collection  said he   Being my friend  s  I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye  but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it  The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet  which Emma could understand  There was deep consciousness about him  and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend  s  He was gone the next moment  after another moment  s pause   Take it  said Emma  smiling  and pushing the paper towards Harriet  it is for you  Take your own  But Harriet was in a tremor  and could not touch it  and Emma  never loth to be first  was obliged to examine it herself  To Miss  CHARADE  My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings  Lords of the earth  their luxury and ease  Another view of man  my second brings  Behold him there  the monarch of the seas  But ah  united  what reverse we have  Man  s boasted power and freedom  all are flown  Lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave  And woman  lovely woman  reigns alone  Thy ready wit the word will soon supply  May its approval beam in that soft eye  She cast her eye over it  pondered  caught the meaning  read it through again to be quite certain  and quite mistress of the lines  and then passing it to Harriet  sat happily smiling  and saying to herself  while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness   Very well  Mr  Elton  very well indeed  I have read worse charades  _Courtship_  a very good hint  I give you credit for it  This is feeling your way  This is saying very plainly ` Pray  Miss Smith  give me leave to pay my addresses to you  Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance  May its approval beam in that soft eye  Harriet exactly  Soft is the very word for her eye  of all epithets  the justest that could be given  Thy ready wit the word will soon supply  Humph  Harriet  s ready wit  All the better  A man must be very much in love  indeed  to describe her so  Ah  Mr  Knightley  I wish you had the benefit of this  I think this would convince you  For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken  An excellent charade indeed  and very much to the purpose  Things must come to a crisis soon now  She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations  which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length  by the eagerness of Harriet  s wondering questions   What can it be  Miss Woodhouse  what can it be  I have not an idea  I cannot guess it in the least  What can it possibly be  Do try to find it out  Miss Woodhouse  Do help me  I never saw any thing so hard  Is it kingdom  I wonder who the friend was  and who could be the young lady  Do you think it is a good one  Can it be woman  And woman  lovely woman  reigns alone  Can it be Neptune  Behold him there  the monarch of the seas  Or a trident  or a mermaid  or a shark  Oh  no  shark is only one syllable  It must be very clever  or he would not have brought it  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  do you think we shall ever find it out   Mermaids and sharks  Nonsense  My dear Harriet  what are you thinking of  Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark  Give me the paper and listen  For Miss  read Miss Smith  My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings  Lords of the earth  their luxury and ease  That is _court_  Another view of man  my second brings  Behold him there  the monarch of the seas  That is _ship_  plain as it can be  Now for the cream  But ah  united   _courtship_  you know  what reverse we have  Man  s boasted power and freedom  all are flown  Lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave  And woman  lovely woman  reigns alone  A very proper compliment  and then follows the application  which I think  my dear Harriet  you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending  Read it in comfort to yourself  There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you  Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion  She read the concluding lines  and was all flutter and happiness  She could not speak  But she was not wanted to speak  It was enough for her to feel  Emma spoke for her   There is so pointed  and so particular a meaning in this compliment  said she   that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr  Elton  s intentions  You are his object  and you will soon receive the completest proof of it  I thought it must be so  I thought I could not be so deceived  but now  it is clear  the state of his mind is as clear and decided  as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you  Yes  Harriet  just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened  I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr  Elton were most desirable or most natural  Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other  I am very happy  I congratulate you  my dear Harriet  with all my heart  This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating  This is a connexion which offers nothing but good  It will give you every thing that you want  consideration  independence  a proper home  it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends  close to Hartfield and to me  and confirm our intimacy for ever  This  Harriet  is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us   Dear Miss Woodhouse  and  Dear Miss Woodhouse  was all that Harriet  with many tender embraces could articulate at first  but when they did arrive at something more like conversation  it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw  felt  anticipated  and remembered just as she ought  Mr  Elton  s superiority had very ample acknowledgment   Whatever you say is always right  cried Harriet   and therefore I suppose  and believe  and hope it must be so  but otherwise I could not have imagined it  It is so much beyond any thing I deserve  Mr  Elton  who might marry any body  There cannot be two opinions about _him_  He is so very superior  Only think of those sweet verses ` To Miss  Dear me  how clever  Could it really be meant for me   I cannot make a question  or listen to a question about that  It is a certainty  Receive it on my judgment  It is a sort of prologue to the play  a motto to the chapter  and will be soon followed by matter  of  fact prose   It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected  I am sure  a month ago  I had no more idea myself  The strangest things do take place   When Miss Smiths and Mr  Eltons get acquainted  they do indeed  and really it is strange  it is out of the common course that what is so evidently  so palpably desirable  what courts the pre  arrangement of other people  should so immediately shape itself into the proper form  You and Mr  Elton are by situation called together  you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes  Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls  There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction  and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow  The course of true love never did run smooth  A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage   That Mr  Elton should really be in love with me  me  of all people  who did not know him  to speak to him  at Michaelmas  And he  the very handsomest man that ever was  and a man that every body looks up to  quite like Mr  Knightley  His company so sought after  that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it  that he has more invitations than there are days in the week  And so excellent in the Church  Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury  Dear me  When I look back to the first time I saw him  How little did I think  The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by  and Miss Nash came and scolded us away  and staid to look through herself  however  she called me back presently  and let me look too  which was very good  natured  And how beautiful we thought he looked  He was arm  in  arm with Mr  Cole   This is an alliance which  whoever  whatever your friends may be  must be agreeable to them  provided at least they have common sense  and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools  If they are anxious to see you _happily_ married  here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it  if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in  here it will be accomplished  and if their only object is that you should  in the common phrase  be _well_ married  here is the comfortable fortune  the respectable establishment  the rise in the world which must satisfy them   Yes  very true  How nicely you talk  I love to hear you  You understand every thing  You and Mr  Elton are one as clever as the other  This charade  If I had studied a twelvemonth  I could never have made any thing like it   I thought he meant to try his skill  by his manner of declining it yesterday   I do think it is  without exception  the best charade I ever read   I never read one more to the purpose  certainly   It is as long again as almost all we have had before   I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour  Such things in general cannot be too short  Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear  The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind   It is one thing  said she  presently  her cheeks in a glow  to have very good sense in a common way  like every body else  and if there is any thing to say  to sit down and write a letter  and say just what you must  in a short way  and another  to write verses and charades like this  Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr  Martin  s prose   Such sweet lines  continued Harriet  these two last  But how shall I ever be able to return the paper  or say I have found it out  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  what can we do about that   Leave it to me  You do nothing  He will be here this evening  I dare say  and then I will give it him back  and some nonsense or other will pass between us  and you shall not be committed  Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming  Trust to me   Oh  Miss Woodhouse  what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book  I am sure I have not got one half so good   Leave out the two last lines  and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book   Oh  but those two lines are   The best of all  Granted  for private enjoyment  and for private enjoyment keep them  They are not at all the less written you know  because you divide them  The couplet does not cease to be  nor does its meaning change  But take it away  and all _appropriation_ ceases  and a very pretty gallant charade remains  fit for any collection  Depend upon it  he would not like to have his charade slighted  much better than his passion  A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities  or neither  Give me the book  I will write it down  and then there can be no possible reflection on you  Harriet submitted  though her mind could hardly separate the parts  so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love  It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity   I shall never let that book go out of my own hands  said she   Very well  replied Emma   a most natural feeling  and the longer it lasts  the better I shall be pleased  But here is my father coming  you will not object to my reading the charade to him  It will be giving him so much pleasure  He loves any thing of the sort  and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment  He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all  You must let me read it to him  Harriet looked grave   My dear Harriet  you must not refine too much upon this charade  You will betray your feelings improperly  if you are too conscious and too quick  and appear to affix more meaning  or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it  Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration  If he had been anxious for secrecy  he would not have left the paper while I was by  but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you  Do not let us be too solemn on the business  He has encouragement enough to proceed  without our sighing out our souls over this charade   Oh  no  I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it  Do as you please  Mr  Woodhouse came in  and very soon led to the subject again  by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of  Well  my dears  how does your book go on  Have you got any thing fresh   Yes  papa  we have something to read you  something quite fresh  A piece of paper was found on the table this morning  dropt  we suppose  by a fairy  containing a very pretty charade  and we have just copied it in  She read it to him  just as he liked to have any thing read  slowly and distinctly  and two or three times over  with explanations of every part as she proceeded  and he was very much pleased  and  as she had foreseen  especially struck with the complimentary conclusion   Aye  that  s very just  indeed  that  s very properly said  Very true  ` Woman  lovely woman  It is such a pretty charade  my dear  that I can easily guess what fairy brought it  Nobody could have written so prettily  but you  Emma  Emma only nodded  and smiled  After a little thinking  and a very tender sigh  he added   Ah  it is no difficulty to see who you take after  Your dear mother was so clever at all those things  If I had but her memory  But I can remember nothing  not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention  I can only recollect the first stanza  and there are several  Kitty  a fair but frozen maid  Kindled a flame I yet deplore  The hood  wink  d boy I called to aid  Though of his near approach afraid  So fatal to my suit before  And that is all that I can recollect of it  but it is very clever all the way through  But I think  my dear  you said you had got it   Yes  papa  it is written out in our second page  We copied it from the Elegant Extracts  It was Garrick  s  you know   Aye  very true  I wish I could recollect more of it  Kitty  a fair but frozen maid  The name makes me think of poor Isabella  for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama  I hope we shall have her here next week  Have you thought  my dear  where you shall put her  and what room there will be for the children   Oh  yes  she will have her own room  of course  the room she always has  and there is the nursery for the children  just as usual  you know  Why should there be any change   I do not know  my dear  but it is so long since she was here  not since last Easter  and then only for a few days  Mr  John Knightley  s being a lawyer is very inconvenient  Poor Isabella  she is sadly taken away from us all  and how sorry she will be when she comes  not to see Miss Taylor here   She will not be surprized  papa  at least   I do not know  my dear  I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married   We must ask Mr  and Mrs  Weston to dine with us  while Isabella is here   Yes  my dear  if there is time  But  in a very depressed tone  she is coming for only one week  There will not be time for any thing   It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer  but it seems a case of necessity  Mr  John Knightley must be in town again on the th  and we ought to be thankful  papa  that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country  that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey  Mr  Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas  though you know it is longer since they were with him  than with us   It would be very hard  indeed  my dear  if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield  Mr  Woodhouse could never allow for Mr  Knightley  s claims on his brother  or any body  s claims on Isabella  except his own  He sat musing a little while  and then said   But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon  though he does  I think  Emma  I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us  She and the children might stay very well   Ah  papa  that is what you never have been able to accomplish  and I do not think you ever will  Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband  This was too true for contradiction  Unwelcome as it was  Mr  Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh  and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter  s attachment to her husband  she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them   Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here  I am sure she will be pleased with the children  We are very proud of the children  are not we  papa  I wonder which she will think the handsomest  Henry or John   Aye  I wonder which she will  Poor little dears  how glad they will be to come  They are very fond of being at Hartfield  Harriet   I dare say they are  sir  I am sure I do not know who is not   Henry is a fine boy  but John is very like his mama  Henry is the eldest  he was named after me  not after his father  John  the second  is named after his father  Some people are surprized  I believe  that the eldest was not  but Isabella would have him called Henry  which I thought very pretty of her  And he is a very clever boy  indeed  They are all remarkably clever  and they have so many pretty ways  They will come and stand by my chair  and say  ` Grandpapa  can you give me a bit of string  and once Henry asked me for a knife  but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas  I think their father is too rough with them very often   He appears rough to you  said Emma   because you are so very gentle yourself  but if you could compare him with other papas  you would not think him rough  He wishes his boys to be active and hardy  and if they misbehave  can give them a sharp word now and then  but he is an affectionate father  certainly Mr  John Knightley is an affectionate father  The children are all fond of him   And then their uncle comes in  and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way   But they like it  papa  there is nothing they like so much  It is such enjoyment to them  that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns  whichever began would never give way to the other   Well  I cannot understand it   That is the case with us all  papa  One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other  Later in the morning  and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o  clock dinner  the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again  Harriet turned away  but Emma could receive him with the usual smile  and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push  of having thrown a die  and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up  His ostensible reason  however  was to ask whether Mr  Woodhouse  s party could be made up in the evening without him  or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield  If he were  every thing else must give way  but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him  had made such a point of it  that he had promised him conditionally to come  Emma thanked him  but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account  her father was sure of his rubber  He re  urged  she re  declined  and he seemed then about to make his bow  when taking the paper from the table  she returned it   Oh  here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us  thank you for the sight of it  We admired it so much  that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith  s collection  Your friend will not take it amiss I hope  Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines  Mr  Elton certainly did not very well know what to say  He looked rather doubtingly  rather confused  said something about  honour  glanced at Emma and at Harriet  and then seeing the book open on the table  took it up  and examined it very attentively  With the view of passing off an awkward moment  Emma smilingly said   You must make my apologies to your friend  but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two  He may be sure of every woman  s approbation while he writes with such gallantry   I have no hesitation in saying  replied Mr  Elton  though hesitating a good deal while he spoke   I have no hesitation in saying  at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do  I have not the smallest doubt that  could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it   looking at the book again  and replacing it on the table  he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life  After this speech he was gone as soon as possible  Emma could not think it too soon  for with all his good and agreeable qualities  there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh  She ran away to indulge the inclination  leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet  s share  CHAPTER X Though now the middle of December  there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise  and on the morrow  Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family  who lived a little way out of Highbury  Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane  a lane leading at right angles from the broad  though irregular  main street of the place  and  as may be inferred  containing the blessed abode of Mr  Elton  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed  and then  about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage  an old and not very good house  almost as close to the road as it could be  It had no advantage of situation  but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor  and  such as it was  there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes  Emma  s remark was   There it is  There go you and your riddle  book one of these days  Harriet  s was   Oh  what a sweet house  How very beautiful  There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much   I do not often walk this way _now_  said Emma  as they proceeded   but _then_ there will be an inducement  and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges  gates  pools and pollards of this part of Highbury  Harriet  she found  had never in her life been within side the Vicarage  and her curiosity to see it was so extreme  that  considering exteriors and probabilities  Emma could only class it  as a proof of love  with Mr  Elton  s seeing ready wit in her   I wish we could contrive it  said she   but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in  no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper  no message from my father  She pondered  but could think of nothing  After a mutual silence of some minutes  Harriet thus began again   I do so wonder  Miss Woodhouse  that you should not be married  or going to be married  so charming as you are  Emma laughed  and replied   My being charming  Harriet  is not quite enough to induce me to marry  I must find other people charming  one other person at least  And I am not only  not going to be married  at present  but have very little intention of ever marrying at all   Ah  so you say  but I cannot believe it   I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet  to be tempted  Mr  Elton  you know   recollecting herself  is out of the question  and I do _not_ wish to see any such person  I would rather not be tempted  I cannot really change for the better  If I were to marry  I must expect to repent it   Dear me  it is so odd to hear a woman talk so   I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry  Were I to fall in love  indeed  it would be a different thing  but I never have been in love  it is not my way  or my nature  and I do not think I ever shall  And  without love  I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine  Fortune I do not want  employment I do not want  consequence I do not want  I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband  s house as I am of Hartfield  and never  never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important  so always first and always right in any man  s eyes as I am in my father  s   But then  to be an old maid at last  like Miss Bates   That is as formidable an image as you could present  Harriet  and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates  so silly  so satisfied  so smiling  so prosing  so undistinguishing and unfastidious  and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me  I would marry to  morrow  But between _us_  I am convinced there never can be any likeness  except in being unmarried   But still  you will be an old maid  and that  s so dreadful   Never mind  Harriet  I shall not be a poor old maid  and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public  A single woman  with a very narrow income  must be a ridiculous  disagreeable old maid  the proper sport of boys and girls  but a single woman  of good fortune  is always respectable  and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else  And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first  for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind  and sour the temper  Those who can barely live  and who live perforce in a very small  and generally very inferior  society  may well be illiberal and cross  This does not apply  however  to Miss Bates  she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me  but  in general  she is very much to the taste of every body  though single and though poor  Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind  I really believe  if she had only a shilling in the world  she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it  and nobody is afraid of her  that is a great charm   Dear me  but what shall you do  how shall you employ yourself when you grow old   If I know myself  Harriet  mine is an active  busy mind  with a great many independent resources  and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one  and  twenty  Woman  s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now  or with no important variation  If I draw less  I shall read more  if I give up music  I shall take to carpet  work  And as for objects of interest  objects for the affections  which is in truth the great point of inferiority  the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying  I shall be very well off  with all the children of a sister I love so much  to care about  There will be enough of them  in all probability  to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need  There will be enough for every hope and every fear  and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent  it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder  My nephews and nieces  I shall often have a niece with me   Do you know Miss Bates  s niece  That is  I know you must have seen her a hundred times  but are you acquainted   Oh  yes  we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury  By the bye  _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece  Heaven forbid  at least  that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together  as she does about Jane Fairfax  One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax  Every letter from her is read forty times over  her compliments to all friends go round and round again  and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher  or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother  one hears of nothing else for a month  I wish Jane Fairfax very well  but she tires me to death  They were now approaching the cottage  and all idle topics were superseded  Emma was very compassionate  and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness  her counsel and her patience  as from her purse  She understood their ways  could allow for their ignorance and their temptations  had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little  entered into their troubles with ready sympathy  and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good  will  In the present instance  it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit  and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice  she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet  as they walked away   These are the sights  Harriet  to do one good  How trifling they make every thing else appear  I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day  and yet  who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind   Very true  said Harriet   Poor creatures  one can think of nothing else   And really  I do not think the impression will soon be over  said Emma  as she crossed the low hedge  and tottering footstep which ended the narrow  slippery path through the cottage garden  and brought them into the lane again   I do not think it will  stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place  and recall the still greater within   Oh  dear  no  said her companion  They walked on  The lane made a slight bend  and when that bend was passed  Mr  Elton was immediately in sight  and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther   Ah  Harriet  here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts  Well   smiling  I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers  it has done all that is truly important  If we feel for the wretched  enough to do all we can for them  the rest is empty sympathy  only distressing to ourselves  Harriet could just answer   Oh  dear  yes  before the gentleman joined them  The wants and sufferings of the poor family  however  were the first subject on meeting  He had been going to call on them  His visit he would now defer  but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done  Mr  Elton then turned back to accompany them   To fall in with each other on such an errand as this  thought Emma   to meet in a charitable scheme  this will bring a great increase of love on each side  I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration  It must  if I were not here  I wish I were anywhere else  Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could  she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath  a little raised on one side of the lane  leaving them together in the main road  But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet  s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too  and that  in short  they would both be soon after her  This would not do  she immediately stopped  under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half  boot  and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath  begged them to have the goodness to walk on  and she would follow in half a minute  They did as they were desired  and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot  she had the comfort of farther delay in her power  being overtaken by a child from the cottage  setting out  according to orders  with her pitcher  to fetch broth from Hartfield  To walk by the side of this child  and talk to and question her  was the most natural thing in the world  or would have been the most natural  had she been acting just then without design  and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead  without any obligation of waiting for her  She gained on them  however  involuntarily  the child  s pace was quick  and theirs rather slow  and she was the more concerned at it  from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them  Mr  Elton was speaking with animation  Harriet listening with a very pleased attention  and Emma  having sent the child on  was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more  when they both looked around  and she was obliged to join them  Mr  Elton was still talking  still engaged in some interesting detail  and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday  s party at his friend Cole  s  and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese  the north Wiltshire  the butter  the cellery  the beet  root  and all the dessert   This would soon have led to something better  of course  was her consoling reflection   any thing interests between those who love  and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart  If I could but have kept longer away  They now walked on together quietly  till within view of the vicarage pales  when a sudden resolution  of at least getting Harriet into the house  made her again find something very much amiss about her boot  and fall behind to arrange it once more  She then broke the lace off short  and dexterously throwing it into a ditch  was presently obliged to entreat them to stop  and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort   Part of my lace is gone  said she   and I do not know how I am to contrive  I really am a most troublesome companion to you both  but I hope I am not often so ill  equipped  Mr  Elton  I must beg leave to stop at your house  and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string  or any thing just to keep my boot on  Mr  Elton looked all happiness at this proposition  and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage  The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied  and looking forwards  behind it was another with which it immediately communicated  the door between them was open  and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it  but she fully intended that Mr  Elton should close it  It was not closed  however  it still remained ajar  but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation  she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room  For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself  It could be protracted no longer  She was then obliged to be finished  and make her appearance  The lovers were standing together at one of the windows  It had a most favourable aspect  and  for half a minute  Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully  But it would not do  he had not come to the point  He had been most agreeable  most delightful  he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by  and had purposely followed them  other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt  but nothing serious   Cautious  very cautious  thought Emma   he advances inch by inch  and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure  Still  however  though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device  she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both  and must be leading them forward to the great event  CHAPTER XI Mr  Elton must now be left to himself  It was no longer in Emma  s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures  The coming of her sister  s family was so very near at hand  that first in anticipation  and then in reality  it became henceforth her prime object of interest  and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected  she did not herself expect  that any thing beyond occasional  fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers  They might advance rapidly if they would  however  they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them  There are people  who the more you do for them  the less they will do for themselves  Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley  from having been longer than usual absent from Surry  were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest  Till this year  every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey  but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea  bathing for the children  and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions  or seen at all by Mr  Woodhouse  who could not be induced to get so far as London  even for poor Isabella  s sake  and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit  He thought much of the evils of the journey for her  and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way  but his alarms were needless  the sixteen miles being happily accomplished  and Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley  their five children  and a competent number of nursery  maids  all reaching Hartfield in safety  The bustle and joy of such an arrival  the many to be talked to  welcomed  encouraged  and variously dispersed and disposed of  produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause  nor have endured much longer even for this  but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs  John Knightley  that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones  and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance  all the eating and drinking  and sleeping and playing  which they could possibly wish for  without the smallest delay  the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him  either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them  Mrs  John Knightley was a pretty  elegant little woman  of gentle  quiet manners  and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate  wrapt up in her family  a devoted wife  a doating mother  and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that  but for these higher ties  a warmer love might have seemed impossible  She could never see a fault in any of them  She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness  and with this resemblance of her father  she inherited also much of his constitution  was delicate in her own health  over  careful of that of her children  had many fears and many nerves  and was as fond of her own Mr  Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr  Perry  They were alike too  in a general benevolence of temper  and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance  Mr  John Knightley was a tall  gentleman  like  and very clever man  rising in his profession  domestic  and respectable in his private character  but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing  and capable of being sometimes out of humour  He was not an ill  tempered man  not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach  but his temper was not his great perfection  and  indeed  with such a worshipping wife  it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his  He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted  and he could sometimes act an ungracious  or say a severe thing  He was not a great favourite with his fair sister  in  law  Nothing wrong in him escaped her  She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella  which Isabella never felt herself  Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella  s sister  but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend  without praise and without blindness  but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into  the want of respectful forbearance towards her father  There he had not always the patience that could have been wished  Mr  Woodhouse  s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill  bestowed  It did not often happen  for Mr  John Knightley had really a great regard for his father  in  law  and generally a strong sense of what was due to him  but it was too often for Emma  s charity  especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured  though the offence came not  The beginning  however  of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings  and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality  They had not been long seated and composed when Mr  Woodhouse  with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh  called his daughter  s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last   Ah  my dear  said he   poor Miss Taylor  It is a grievous business   Oh yes  sir  cried she with ready sympathy   how you must miss her  And dear Emma  too  What a dreadful loss to you both  I have been so grieved for you  I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her  It is a sad change indeed  But I hope she is pretty well  sir   Pretty well  my dear  I hope  pretty well  I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably  Mr  John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls   Oh  no  none in the least  I never saw Mrs  Weston better in my life  never looking so well  Papa is only speaking his own regret   Very much to the honour of both  was the handsome reply   And do you see her  sir  tolerably often  asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father  Mr  Woodhouse hesitated  Not near so often  my dear  as I could wish   Oh  papa  we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married  Either in the morning or evening of every day  excepting one  have we seen either Mr  Weston or Mrs  Weston  and generally both  either at Randalls or here  and as you may suppose  Isabella  most frequently here  They are very  very kind in their visits  Mr  Weston is really as kind as herself  Papa  if you speak in that melancholy way  you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all  Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed  but every body ought also to be assured that Mr  and Mrs  Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated  which is the exact truth   Just as it should be  said Mr  John Knightley   and just as I hoped it was from your letters  Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted  and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy  I have been always telling you  my love  that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended  and now you have Emma  s account  I hope you will be satisfied   Why  to be sure  said Mr  Woodhouse  yes  certainly  I cannot deny that Mrs  Weston  poor Mrs  Weston  does come and see us pretty often  but then  she is always obliged to go away again   It would be very hard upon Mr  Weston if she did not  papa  You quite forget poor Mr  Weston   I think  indeed  said John Knightley pleasantly   that Mr  Weston has some little claim  You and I  Emma  will venture to take the part of the poor husband  I  being a husband  and you not being a wife  the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force  As for Isabella  she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr  Westons aside as much as she can   Me  my love  cried his wife  hearing and understanding only in part   Are you talking about me  I am sure nobody ought to be  or can be  a greater advocate for matrimony than I am  and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield  I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world  and as to slighting Mr  Weston  that excellent Mr  Weston  I think there is nothing he does not deserve  I believe he is one of the very best  tempered men that ever existed  Excepting yourself and your brother  I do not know his equal for temper  I shall never forget his flying Henry  s kite for him that very windy day last Easter  and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note  at twelve o  clock at night  on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham  I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence  If any body can deserve him  it must be Miss Taylor   Where is the young man  said John Knightley   Has he been here on this occasion  or has he not   He has not been here yet  replied Emma   There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage  but it ended in nothing  and I have not heard him mentioned lately   But you should tell them of the letter  my dear  said her father   He wrote a letter to poor Mrs  Weston  to congratulate her  and a very proper  handsome letter it was  She shewed it to me  I thought it very well done of him indeed  Whether it was his own idea you know  one cannot tell  He is but young  and his uncle  perhaps   My dear papa  he is three  and  twenty  You forget how time passes   Three  and  twenty  is he indeed  Well  I could not have thought it  and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother  Well  time does fly indeed  and my memory is very bad  However  it was an exceeding good  pretty letter  and gave Mr  and Mrs  Weston a great deal of pleasure  I remember it was written from Weymouth  and dated Sept  th  and began  ` My dear Madam  but I forget how it went on  and it was signed ` F  C  Weston Churchill  I remember that perfectly   How very pleasing and proper of him  cried the good  hearted Mrs  John Knightley   I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man  But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father  There is something so shocking in a child  s being taken away from his parents and natural home  I never could comprehend how Mr  Weston could part with him  To give up one  s child  I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else   Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills  I fancy  observed Mr  John Knightley coolly   But you need not imagine Mr  Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John  Mr  Weston is rather an easy  cheerful  tempered man  than a man of strong feelings  he takes things as he finds them  and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other  depending  I suspect  much more upon what is called society for his comforts  that is  upon the power of eating and drinking  and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week  than upon family affection  or any thing that home affords  Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr  Weston  and had half a mind to take it up  but she struggled  and let it pass  She would keep the peace if possible  and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits  the all  sufficiency of home to himself  whence resulted her brother  s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse  and those to whom it was important  It had a high claim to forbearance  CHAPTER XII Mr  Knightley was to dine with them  rather against the inclination of Mr  Woodhouse  who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella  s first day  Emma  s sense of right however had decided it  and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother  she had particular pleasure  from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr  Knightley and herself  in procuring him the proper invitation  She hoped they might now become friends again  She thought it was time to make up  Making  up indeed would not do  _She_ certainly had not been in the wrong  and _he_ would never own that he had  Concession must be out of the question  but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled  and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship  that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her  the youngest  a nice little girl about eight months old  who was now making her first visit to Hartfield  and very happy to be danced about in her aunt  s arms  It did assist  for though he began with grave looks and short questions  he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way  and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity  Emma felt they were friends again  and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction  and then a little sauciness  she could not help saying  as he was admiring the baby   What a comfort it is  that we think alike about our nephews and nieces  As to men and women  our opinions are sometimes very different  but with regard to these children  I observe we never disagree   If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women  and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them  as you are where these children are concerned  we might always think alike   To be sure  our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong   Yes  said he  smiling  and reason good  I was sixteen years old when you were born   A material difference then  she replied  and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives  but does not the lapse of one  and  twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer   Yes  a good deal _nearer_   But still  not near enough to give me a chance of being right  if we think differently   I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years  experience  and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child  Come  my dear Emma  let us be friends  and say no more about it  Tell your aunt  little Emma  that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances  and that if she were not wrong before  she is now   That  s true  she cried  very true  Little Emma  grow up a better woman than your aunt  Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited  Now  Mr  Knightley  a word or two more  and I have done  As far as good intentions went  we were _both_ right  and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong  I only want to know that Mr  Martin is not very  very bitterly disappointed   A man cannot be more so  was his short  full answer   Ah  Indeed I am very sorry  Come  shake hands with me  This had just taken place and with great cordiality  when John Knightley made his appearance  and  How d  ye do  George  and  John  how are you  succeeded in the true English style  burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference  the real attachment which would have led either of them  if requisite  to do every thing for the good of the other  The evening was quiet and conversable  as Mr  Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella  and the little party made two natural divisions  on one side he and his daughter  on the other the two Mr  Knightleys  their subjects totally distinct  or very rarely mixing  and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other  The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits  but principally of those of the elder  whose temper was by much the most communicative  and who was always the greater talker  As a magistrate  he had generally some point of law to consult John about  or  at least  some curious anecdote to give  and as a farmer  as keeping in hand the home  farm at Donwell  he had to tell what every field was to bear next year  and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life  and whose attachments were strong  The plan of a drain  the change of a fence  the felling of a tree  and the destination of every acre for wheat  turnips  or spring corn  was entered into with as much equality of interest by John  as his cooler manners rendered possible  and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about  his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness  While they were thus comfortably occupied  Mr  Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter   My poor dear Isabella  said he  fondly taking her hand  and interrupting  for a few moments  her busy labours for some one of her five children  How long it is  how terribly long since you were here  And how tired you must be after your journey  You must go to bed early  my dear  and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go  You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together  My dear Emma  suppose we all have a little gruel  Emma could not suppose any such thing  knowing as she did  that both the Mr  Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself  and two basins only were ordered  After a little more discourse in praise of gruel  with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body  he proceeded to say  with an air of grave reflection   It was an awkward business  my dear  your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here  I never had much opinion of the sea air   Mr  Wingfield most strenuously recommended it  sir  or we should not have gone  He recommended it for all the children  but particularly for the weakness in little Bella  s throat  both sea air and bathing   Ah  my dear  but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good  and as to myself  I have been long perfectly convinced  though perhaps I never told you so before  that the sea is very rarely of use to any body  I am sure it almost killed me once   Come  come  cried Emma  feeling this to be an unsafe subject   I must beg you not to talk of the sea  It makes me envious and miserable  I who have never seen it  South End is prohibited  if you please  My dear Isabella  I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr  Perry yet  and he never forgets you   Oh  good Mr  Perry  how is he  sir   Why  pretty well  but not quite well  Poor Perry is bilious  and he has not time to take care of himself  he tells me he has not time to take care of himself  which is very sad  but he is always wanted all round the country  I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere  But then there is not so clever a man any where   And Mrs  Perry and the children  how are they  do the children grow  I have a great regard for Mr  Perry  I hope he will be calling soon  He will be so pleased to see my little ones   I hope he will be here to  morrow  for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence  And  my dear  whenever he comes  you had better let him look at little Bella  s throat   Oh  my dear sir  her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it  Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her  or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr  Wingfield  s  which we have been applying at times ever since August   It is not very likely  my dear  that bathing should have been of use to her  and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation  I would have spoken to   You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs  and Miss Bates  said Emma   I have not heard one inquiry after them   Oh  the good Bateses  I am quite ashamed of myself  but you mention them in most of your letters  I hope they are quite well  Good old Mrs  Bates  I will call upon her to  morrow  and take my children  They are always so pleased to see my children  And that excellent Miss Bates  such thorough worthy people  How are they  sir   Why  pretty well  my dear  upon the whole  But poor Mrs  Bates had a bad cold about a month ago   How sorry I am  But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn  Mr  Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy  except when it has been quite an influenza   That has been a good deal the case  my dear  but not to the degree you mention  Perry says that colds have been very general  but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November  Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season   No  I do not know that Mr  Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except   Ah  my poor dear child  the truth is  that in London it is always a sickly season  Nobody is healthy in London  nobody can be  It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there  so far off  and the air so bad   No  indeed  _we_ are not at all in a bad air  Our part of London is very superior to most others  You must not confound us with London in general  my dear sir  The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest  We are so very airy  I should be unwilling  I own  to live in any other part of the town  there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in  but _we_ are so remarkably airy  Mr  Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air   Ah  my dear  it is not like Hartfield  You make the best of it  but after you have been a week at Hartfield  you are all of you different creatures  you do not look like the same  Now I cannot say  that I think you are any of you looking well at present   I am sorry to hear you say so  sir  but I assure you  excepting those little nervous head  aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere  I am quite well myself  and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed  it was only because they were a little more tired than usual  from their journey and the happiness of coming  I hope you will think better of their looks to  morrow  for I assure you Mr  Wingfield told me  that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether  in such good case  I trust  at least  that you do not think Mr  Knightley looking ill  turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband   Middling  my dear  I cannot compliment you  I think Mr  John Knightley very far from looking well   What is the matter  sir  Did you speak to me  cried Mr  John Knightley  hearing his own name   I am sorry to find  my love  that my father does not think you looking well  but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued  I could have wished  however  as you know  that you had seen Mr  Wingfield before you left home   My dear Isabella  exclaimed he hastily  pray do not concern yourself about my looks  Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children  and let me look as I chuse   I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother  cried Emma   about your friend Mr  Graham  s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland  to look after his new estate  What will it answer  Will not the old prejudice be too strong  And she talked in this way so long and successfully that  when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister  she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella  s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax  and Jane Fairfax  though no great favourite with her in general  she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising   That sweet  amiable Jane Fairfax  said Mrs  John Knightley   It is so long since I have seen her  except now and then for a moment accidentally in town  What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt  when she comes to visit them  I always regret excessively on dear Emma  s account that she cannot be more at Highbury  but now their daughter is married  I suppose Colonel and Mrs  Campbell will not be able to part with her at all  She would be such a delightful companion for Emma  Mr  Woodhouse agreed to it all  but added   Our little friend Harriet Smith  however  is just such another pretty kind of young person  You will like Harriet  Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet   I am most happy to hear it  but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior  and exactly Emma  s age  This topic was discussed very happily  and others succeeded of similar moment  and passed away with similar harmony  but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation  The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said  much praise and many comments  undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution  and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable  but  unfortunately  among the failures which the daughter had to instance  the most recent  and therefore most prominent  was in her own cook at South End  a young woman hired for the time  who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel  thin  but not too thin  Often as she had wished for and ordered it  she had never been able to get any thing tolerable  Here was a dangerous opening   Ah  said Mr  Woodhouse  shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern  The ejaculation in Emma  s ear expressed   Ah  there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End  It does not bear talking of  And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it  and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel  After an interval of some minutes  however  he began with   I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn  instead of coming here   But why should you be sorry  sir  I assure you  it did the children a great deal of good   And  moreover  if you must go to the sea  it had better not have been to South End  South End is an unhealthy place  Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End   I know there is such an idea with many people  but indeed it is quite a mistake  sir  We all had our health perfectly well there  never found the least inconvenience from the mud  and Mr  Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy  and I am sure he may be depended on  for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air  and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly   You should have gone to Cromer  my dear  if you went anywhere  Perry was a week at Cromer once  and he holds it to be the best of all the sea  bathing places  A fine open sea  he says  and very pure air  And  by what I understand  you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea  a quarter of a mile off  very comfortable  You should have consulted Perry   But  my dear sir  the difference of the journey  only consider how great it would have been  An hundred miles  perhaps  instead of forty   Ah  my dear  as Perry says  where health is at stake  nothing else should be considered  and if one is to travel  there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred  Better not move at all  better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air  This is just what Perry said  It seemed to him a very ill  judged measure  Emma  s attempts to stop her father had been vain  and when he had reached such a point as this  she could not wonder at her brother  in  law  s breaking out   Mr  Perry  said he  in a voice of very strong displeasure   would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for  Why does he make it any business of his  to wonder at what I do  at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another  I may be allowed  I hope  the use of my judgment as well as Mr  Perry  I want his directions no more than his drugs  He paused  and growing cooler in a moment  added  with only sarcastic dryness   If Mr  Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty  I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself   True  true  cried Mr  Knightley  with most ready interposition   very true  That  s a consideration indeed  But John  as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham  of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows  I cannot conceive any difficulty  I should not attempt it  if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people  but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path     The only way of proving it  however  will be to turn to our maps  I shall see you at the Abbey to  morrow morning I hope  and then we will look them over  and you shall give me your opinion  Mr  Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry  to whom he had  in fact  though unconsciously  been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions  but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil  and the immediate alertness of one brother  and better recollections of the other  prevented any renewal of it  CHAPTER XIII There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs  John Knightley  in this short visit to Hartfield  going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children  and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister  She had nothing to wish otherwise  but that the days did not pass so swiftly  It was a delightful visit  perfect  in being much too short  In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings  but one complete dinner engagement  and out of the house too  there was no avoiding  though at Christmas  Mr  Weston would take no denial  they must all dine at Randalls one day  even Mr  Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party  How they were all to be conveyed  he would have made a difficulty if he could  but as his son and daughter  s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield  he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head  it hardly amounted to a doubt  nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also  Harriet  Mr  Elton  and Mr  Knightley  their own especial set  were the only persons invited to meet them  the hours were to be early  as well as the numbers few  Mr  Woodhouse  s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing  The evening before this great event  for it was a very great event that Mr  Woodhouse should dine out  on the th of December  had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield  and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold  that  but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs  Goddard  Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house  Emma called on her the next day  and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls  She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat  Mrs  Goddard was full of care and affection  Mr  Perry was talked of  and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement  though she could not speak of her loss without many tears  Emma sat with her as long as she could  to attend her in Mrs  Goddard  s unavoidable absences  and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr  Elton  s would be depressed when he knew her state  and left her at last tolerably comfortable  in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit  and of their all missing her very much  She had not advanced many yards from Mrs  Goddard  s door  when she was met by Mr  Elton himself  evidently coming towards it  and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid  of whom he  on the rumour of considerable illness  had been going to inquire  that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield  they were overtaken by Mr  John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell  with his two eldest boys  whose healthy  glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run  and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for  They joined company and proceeded together  Emma was just describing the nature of her friend  s complaint   a throat very much inflamed  with a great deal of heat about her  a quick  low pulse  & c  and she was sorry to find from Mrs  Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore  throats  and had often alarmed her with them  Mr  Elton looked all alarm on the occasion  as he exclaimed   A sore  throat  I hope not infectious  I hope not of a putrid infectious sort  Has Perry seen her  Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend  Let me entreat you to run no risks  Why does not Perry see her  Emma  who was not really at all frightened herself  tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs  Goddard  s experience and care  but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away  which she would rather feed and assist than not  she added soon afterwards  as if quite another subject   It is so cold  so very cold  and looks and feels so very much like snow  that if it were to any other place or with any other party  I should really try not to go out to  day  and dissuade my father from venturing  but as he has made up his mind  and does not seem to feel the cold himself  I do not like to interfere  as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr  and Mrs  Weston  But  upon my word  Mr  Elton  in your case  I should certainly excuse myself  You appear to me a little hoarse already  and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to  morrow will bring  I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to  night  Mr  Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make  which was exactly the case  for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady  and not liking to resist any advice of her  s  he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit  but Emma  too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially  or see him with clear vision  was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being  very cold  certainly very cold  and walked on  rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls  and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening   You do quite right  said she  we will make your apologies to Mr  and Mrs  Weston  But hardly had she so spoken  when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage  if the weather were Mr  Elton  s only objection  and Mr  Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction  It was a done thing  Mr  Elton was to go  and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment  never had his smile been stronger  nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her   Well  said she to herself   this is most strange  After I had got him off so well  to chuse to go into company  and leave Harriet ill behind  Most strange indeed  But there is  I believe  in many men  especially single men  such an inclination  such a passion for dining out  a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures  their employments  their dignities  almost their duties  that any thing gives way to it  and this must be the case with Mr  Elton  a most valuable  amiable  pleasing young man undoubtedly  and very much in love with Harriet  but still  he cannot refuse an invitation  he must dine out wherever he is asked  What a strange thing love is  he can see ready wit in Harriet  but will not dine alone for her  Soon afterwards Mr  Elton quitted them  and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting  in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs  Goddard  s for news of her fair friend  the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again  when he hoped to be able to give a better report  and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour  After a few minutes of entire silence between them  John Knightley began with   I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr  Elton  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned  With men he can be rational and unaffected  but when he has ladies to please  every feature works   Mr  Elton  s manners are not perfect  replied Emma   but where there is a wish to please  one ought to overlook  and one does overlook a great deal  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers  he will have the advantage over negligent superiority  There is such perfect good  temper and good  will in Mr  Elton as one cannot but value   Yes  said Mr  John Knightley presently  with some slyness   he seems to have a great deal of good  will towards you   Me  she replied with a smile of astonishment   are you imagining me to be Mr  Elton  s object   Such an imagination has crossed me  I own  Emma  and if it never occurred to you before  you may as well take it into consideration now   Mr  Elton in love with me  What an idea   I do not say it is so  but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not  and to regulate your behaviour accordingly  I think your manners to him encouraging  I speak as a friend  Emma  You had better look about you  and ascertain what you do  and what you mean to do   I thank you  but I assure you you are quite mistaken  Mr  Elton and I are very good friends  and nothing more  and she walked on  amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances  of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into  and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant  and in want of counsel  He said no more  Mr  Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit  that in spite of the increasing coldness  he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it  and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage  with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others  too full of the wonder of his own going  and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold  and too well wrapt up to feel it  The cold  however  was severe  and by the time the second carriage was in motion  a few flakes of snow were finding their way down  and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time  Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour  The preparing and the going abroad in such weather  with the sacrifice of his children after dinner  were evils  were disagreeables at least  which Mr  John Knightley did not by any means like  he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase  and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent   A man  said he   must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside  and encounter such a day as this  for the sake of coming to see him  He must think himself a most agreeable fellow  I could not do such a thing  It is the greatest absurdity  Actually snowing at this moment  The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home  and the folly of people  s not staying comfortably at home when they can  If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this  by any call of duty or business  what a hardship we should deem it  and here are we  probably with rather thinner clothing than usual  setting forward voluntarily  without excuse  in defiance of the voice of nature  which tells man  in every thing given to his view or his feelings  to stay at home himself  and keep all under shelter that he can  here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man  s house  with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday  and may not be said and heard again to  morrow  Going in dismal weather  to return probably in worse  four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle  shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home  Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent  which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving  to emulate the  Very true  my love  which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion  but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all  She could not be complying  she dreaded being quarrelsome  her heroism reached only to silence  She allowed him to talk  and arranged the glasses  and wrapped herself up  without opening her lips  They arrived  the carriage turned  the step was let down  and Mr  Elton  spruce  black  and smiling  was with them instantly  Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject  Mr  Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness  he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed  that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her  She had sent while dressing  and the answer had been   Much the same  not better   _My_ report from Mrs  Goddard  s  said she presently   was not so pleasant as I had hoped ` Not better  was _my_ answer  His face lengthened immediately  and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered   Oh  no  I am grieved to find  I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs  Goddard  s door  which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress  I was told that Miss Smith was not better  by no means better  rather worse  Very much grieved and concerned  I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning  Emma smiled and answered  My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint  I hope  but not even I can charm away a sore throat  it is a most severe cold indeed  Mr  Perry has been with her  as you probably heard   Yes  I imagined  that is  I did not   He has been used to her in these complaints  and I hope to  morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report  But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness  Such a sad loss to our party to  day   Dreadful  Exactly so  indeed  She will be missed every moment  This was very proper  the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable  but it should have lasted longer  Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things  and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment   What an excellent device  said he   the use of a sheepskin for carriages  How very comfortable they make it  impossible to feel cold with such precautions  The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman  s carriage perfectly complete  One is so fenced and guarded from the weather  that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted  Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence  It is a very cold afternoon  but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter  Ha  snows a little I see   Yes  said John Knightley   and I think we shall have a good deal of it   Christmas weather  observed Mr  Elton   Quite seasonable  and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday  and prevent this day  s party  which it might very possibly have done  for Mr  Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground  but now it is of no consequence  This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings  At Christmas every body invites their friends about them  and people think little of even the worst weather  I was snowed up at a friend  s house once for a week  Nothing could be pleasanter  I went for only one night  and could not get away till that very day se  nnight  Mr  John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure  but said only  coolly   I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls  At another time Emma might have been amused  but she was too much astonished now at Mr  Elton  s spirits for other feelings  Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party   We are sure of excellent fires  continued he   and every thing in the greatest comfort  Charming people  Mr  and Mrs  Weston  Mrs  Weston indeed is much beyond praise  and he is exactly what one values  so hospitable  and so fond of society  it will be a small party  but where small parties are select  they are perhaps the most agreeable of any  Mr  Weston  s dining  room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably  and for my part  I would rather  under such circumstances  fall short by two than exceed by two  I think you will agree with me   turning with a soft air to Emma  I think I shall certainly have your approbation  though Mr  Knightley perhaps  from being used to the large parties of London  may not quite enter into our feelings   I know nothing of the large parties of London  sir  I never dine with any body   Indeed   in a tone of wonder and pity  I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery  Well  sir  the time must come when you will be paid for all this  when you will have little labour and great enjoyment   My first enjoyment  replied John Knightley  as they passed through the sweep  gate   will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again  CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs  Weston  s drawing  room  Mr  Elton must compose his joyous looks  and Mr  John Knightley disperse his ill  humour  Mr  Elton must smile less  and Mr  John Knightley more  to fit them for the place  Emma only might be as nature prompted  and shew herself just as happy as she was  To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons  Mr  Weston was a great favourite  and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve  as to his wife  not any one  to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood  of being always interesting and always intelligible  the little affairs  arrangements  perplexities  and pleasures of her father and herself  She could tell nothing of Hartfield  in which Mrs  Weston had not a lively concern  and half an hour  s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends  was one of the first gratifications of each  This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day  s visit might not afford  which certainly did not belong to the present half  hour  but the very sight of Mrs  Weston  her smile  her touch  her voice was grateful to Emma  and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr  Elton  s oddities  or of any thing else unpleasant  and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost  The misfortune of Harriet  s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival  Mr  Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it  besides all the history of his own and Isabella  s coming  and of Emma  s being to follow  and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter  when the others appeared  and Mrs  Weston  who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him  was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma  Emma  s project of forgetting Mr  Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find  when they had all taken their places  that he was close to her  The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet  from her mind  while he not only sat at her elbow  but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice  and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion  Instead of forgetting him  his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of  Can it really be as my brother imagined  can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me  Absurd and insufferable  Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm  would be so interested about her father  and so delighted with Mrs  Weston  and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would  be lover  and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners  For her own sake she could not be rude  and for Harriet  s  in the hope that all would yet turn out right  she was even positively civil  but it was an effort  especially as something was going on amongst the others  in the most overpowering period of Mr  Elton  s nonsense  which she particularly wished to listen to  She heard enough to know that Mr  Weston was giving some information about his son  she heard the words  my son  and  Frank  and  my son  repeated several times over  and  from a few other half  syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son  but before she could quiet Mr  Elton  the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward  Now  it so happened that in spite of Emma  s resolution of never marrying  there was something in the name  in the idea of Mr  Frank Churchill  which always interested her  She had frequently thought  especially since his father  s marriage with Miss Taylor  that if she _were_ to marry  he was the very person to suit her in age  character and condition  He seemed by this connexion between the families  quite to belong to her  She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of  That Mr  and Mrs  Weston did think of it  she was very strongly persuaded  and though not meaning to be induced by him  or by any body else  to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for  she had a great curiosity to see him  a decided intention of finding him pleasant  of being liked by him to a certain degree  and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends  imaginations  With such sensations  Mr  Elton  s civilities were dreadfully ill  timed  but she had the comfort of appearing very polite  while feeling very cross  and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again  or the substance of it  from the open  hearted Mr  Weston  So it proved  for when happily released from Mr  Elton  and seated by Mr  Weston  at dinner  he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality  the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton  to say to her   We want only two more to be just the right number  I should like to see two more here  your pretty little friend  Miss Smith  and my son  and then I should say we were quite complete  I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing  room that we are expecting Frank  I had a letter from him this morning  and he will be with us within a fortnight  Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure  and fully assented to his proposition of Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete   He has been wanting to come to us  continued Mr  Weston   ever since September  every letter has been full of it  but he cannot command his own time  He has those to please who must be pleased  and who  between ourselves  are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices  But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January   What a very great pleasure it will be to you  and Mrs  Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him  that she must be almost as happy as yourself   Yes  she would be  but that she thinks there will be another put  off  She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do  but she does not know the parties so well as I do  The case  you see  is  but this is quite between ourselves  I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room  There are secrets in all families  you know  The case is  that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January  and that Frank  s coming depends upon their being put off  If they are not put off  he cannot stir  But I know they will  because it is a family that a certain lady  of some consequence  at Enscombe  has a particular dislike to  and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years  they always are put off when it comes to the point  I have not the smallest doubt of the issue  I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January  as I am of being here myself  but your good friend there  nodding towards the upper end of the table  has so few vagaries herself  and has been so little used to them at Hartfield  that she cannot calculate on their effects  as I have been long in the practice of doing   I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case  replied Emma   but am disposed to side with you  Mr  Weston  If you think he will come  I shall think so too  for you know Enscombe   Yes  I have some right to that knowledge  though I have never been at the place in my life  She is an odd woman  But I never allow myself to speak ill of her  on Frank  s account  for I do believe her to be very fond of him  I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body  except herself  but she has always been kind to him  in her way  allowing for little whims and caprices  and expecting every thing to be as she likes  And it is no small credit  in my opinion  to him  that he should excite such an affection  for  though I would not say it to any body else  she has no more heart than a stone to people in general  and the devil of a temper  Emma liked the subject so well  that she began upon it  to Mrs  Weston  very soon after their moving into the drawing  room  wishing her joy  yet observing  that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming  Mrs  Weston agreed to it  but added  that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of   for I cannot depend upon his coming  I cannot be so sanguine as Mr  Weston  I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing  Mr  Weston  I dare say  has been telling you exactly how the matter stands   Yes  it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill  humour of Mrs  Churchill  which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world   My Emma  replied Mrs  Weston  smiling   what is the certainty of caprice  Then turning to Isabella  who had not been attending before  You must know  my dear Mrs  Knightley  that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr  Frank Churchill  in my opinion  as his father thinks  It depends entirely upon his aunt  s spirits and pleasure  in short  upon her temper  To you  to my two daughters  I may venture on the truth  Mrs  Churchill rules at Enscombe  and is a very odd  tempered woman  and his coming now  depends upon her being willing to spare him   Oh  Mrs  Churchill  every body knows Mrs  Churchill  replied Isabella   and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion  To be constantly living with an ill  tempered person  must be dreadful  It is what we happily have never known any thing of  but it must be a life of misery  What a blessing  that she never had any children  Poor little creatures  how unhappy she would have made them  Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs  Weston  She should then have heard more  Mrs  Weston would speak to her  with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella  and  she really believed  would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her  excepting those views on the young man  of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge  But at present there was nothing more to be said  Mr  Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing  room  To be sitting long after dinner  was a confinement that he could not endure  Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him  and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable  While he talked to Isabella  however  Emma found an opportunity of saying   And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain  I am sorry for it  The introduction must be unpleasant  whenever it takes place  and the sooner it could be over  the better   Yes  and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays  Even if this family  the Braithwaites  are put off  I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us  I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side  but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills  to keep him to themselves  There is jealousy  They are jealous even of his regard for his father  In short  I can feel no dependence on his coming  and I wish Mr  Weston were less sanguine   He ought to come  said Emma   If he could stay only a couple of days  he ought to come  and one can hardly conceive a young man  s not having it in his power to do as much as that  A young _woman_  if she fall into bad hands  may be teazed  and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with  but one cannot comprehend a young _man_  s being under such restraint  as not to be able to spend a week with his father  if he likes it   One ought to be at Enscombe  and know the ways of the family  before one decides upon what he can do  replied Mrs  Weston   One ought to use the same caution  perhaps  in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family  but Enscombe  I believe  certainly must not be judged by general rules  _she_ is so very unreasonable  and every thing gives way to her   But she is so fond of the nephew  he is so very great a favourite  Now  according to my idea of Mrs  Churchill  it would be most natural  that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband  to whom she owes every thing  while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_  she should frequently be governed by the nephew  to whom she owes nothing at all   My dearest Emma  do not pretend  with your sweet temper  to understand a bad one  or to lay down rules for it  you must let it go its own way  I have no doubt of his having  at times  considerable influence  but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be  Emma listened  and then coolly said   I shall not be satisfied  unless he comes   He may have a great deal of influence on some points  continued Mrs  Weston   and on others  very little  and among those  on which she is beyond his reach  it is but too likely  may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us  CHAPTER XV Mr  Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea  and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home  and it was as much as his three companions could do  to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour  before the other gentlemen appeared  Mr  Weston was chatty and convivial  and no friend to early separations of any sort  but at last the drawing  room party did receive an augmentation  Mr  Elton  in very good spirits  was one of the first to walk in  Mrs  Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa  He joined them immediately  and  with scarcely an invitation  seated himself between them  Emma  in good spirits too  from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr  Frank Churchill  was willing to forget his late improprieties  and be as well satisfied with him as before  and on his making Harriet his very first subject  was ready to listen with most friendly smiles  He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend  her fair  lovely  amiable friend   Did she know  had she heard any thing about her  since their being at Randalls  he felt much anxiety  he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably  And in this style he talked on for some time very properly  not much attending to any answer  but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat  and Emma was quite in charity with him  But at last there seemed a perverse turn  it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account  than on Harriet  s  more anxious that she should escape the infection  than that there should be no infection in the complaint  He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick  chamber again  for the present  to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr  Perry and learnt his opinion  and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course  there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her  She was vexed  It did appear  there was no concealing it  exactly like the pretence of being in love with her  instead of Harriet  an inconstancy  if real  the most contemptible and abominable  and she had difficulty in behaving with temper  He turned to Mrs  Weston to implore her assistance   Would not she give him her support  would not she add her persuasions to his  to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs  Goddard  s till it were certain that Miss Smith  s disorder had no infection  He could not be satisfied without a promise  would not she give him her influence in procuring it   So scrupulous for others  he continued   and yet so careless for herself  She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to  day  and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself  Is this fair  Mrs  Weston  Judge between us  Have not I some right to complain  I am sure of your kind support and aid  Emma saw Mrs  Weston  s surprize  and felt that it must be great  at an address which  in words and manner  was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her  and as for herself  she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose  She could only give him a look  but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses  and then left the sofa  removing to a seat by her sister  and giving her all her attention  She had not time to know how Mr  Elton took the reproof  so rapidly did another subject succeed  for Mr  John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather  and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow  and of its still snowing fast  with a strong drifting wind  concluding with these words to Mr  Woodhouse   This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements  sir  Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow  Poor Mr  Woodhouse was silent from consternation  but every body else had something to say  every body was either surprized or not surprized  and had some question to ask  or some comfort to offer  Mrs  Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son  in  law  who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly   I admired your resolution very much  sir  said he   in venturing out in such weather  for of course you saw there would be snow very soon  Every body must have seen the snow coming on  I admired your spirit  and I dare say we shall get home very well  Another hour or two  s snow can hardly make the road impassable  and we are two carriages  if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand  I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight  Mr  Weston  with triumph of a different sort  was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time  but had not said a word  lest it should make Mr  Woodhouse uncomfortable  and be an excuse for his hurrying away  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return  that was a mere joke  he was afraid they would find no difficulty  He wished the road might be impassable  that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls  and with the utmost good  will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body  calling on his wife to agree with him  that with a little contrivance  every body might be lodged  which she hardly knew how to do  from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house   What is to be done  my dear Emma  what is to be done  was Mr  Woodhouse  s first exclamation  and all that he could say for some time  To her he looked for comfort  and her assurances of safety  her representation of the excellence of the horses  and of James  and of their having so many friends about them  revived him a little  His eldest daughter  s alarm was equal to his own  The horror of being blocked up at Randalls  while her children were at Hartfield  was full in her imagination  and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people  but in a state that admitted no delay  she was eager to have it settled  that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls  while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them   You had better order the carriage directly  my love  said she   I dare say we shall be able to get along  if we set off directly  and if we do come to any thing very bad  I can get out and walk  I am not at all afraid  I should not mind walking half the way  I could change my shoes  you know  the moment I got home  and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold   Indeed  replied he   Then  my dear Isabella  it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world  for in general every thing does give you cold  Walk home  you are prettily shod for walking home  I dare say  It will be bad enough for the horses  Isabella turned to Mrs  Weston for her approbation of the plan  Mrs  Weston could only approve  Isabella then went to Emma  but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away  and they were still discussing the point  when Mr  Knightley  who had left the room immediately after his brother  s first report of the snow  came back again  and told them that he had been out of doors to examine  and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home  whenever they liked it  either now or an hour hence  He had gone beyond the sweep  some way along the Highbury road  the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep  in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground  a very few flakes were falling at present  but the clouds were parting  and there was every appearance of its being soon over  He had seen the coachmen  and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend  To Isabella  the relief of such tidings was very great  and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father  s account  who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed  but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home  but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay  and while the others were variously urging and recommending  Mr  Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences  thus   Your father will not be easy  why do not you go   I am ready  if the others are   Shall I ring the bell   Yes  do  And the bell was rung  and the carriages spoken for  A few minutes more  and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house  to get sober and cool  and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over  The carriage came  and Mr  Woodhouse  always the first object on such occasions  was carefully attended to his own by Mr  Knightley and Mr  Weston  but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen  and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for   He was afraid they should have a very bad drive  He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it  And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind  He did not know what they had best do  They must keep as much together as they could  and James was talked to  and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage  Isabella stept in after her father  John Knightley  forgetting that he did not belong to their party  stept in after his wife very naturally  so that Emma found  on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr  Elton  that the door was to be lawfully shut on them  and that they were to have a tete  a  tete drive  It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment  it would have been rather a pleasure  previous to the suspicions of this very day  she could have talked to him of Harriet  and the three  quarters of a mile would have seemed but one  But now  she would rather it had not happened  She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr  Weston  s good wine  and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense  To restrain him as much as might be  by her own manners  she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night  but scarcely had she begun  scarcely had they passed the sweep  gate and joined the other carriage  than she found her subject cut up  her hand seized  her attention demanded  and Mr  Elton actually making violent love to her  availing himself of the precious opportunity  declaring sentiments which must be already well known  hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him  but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect  and in short  very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible  It really was so  Without scruple  without apology  without much apparent diffidence  Mr  Elton  the lover of Harriet  was professing himself _her_ lover  She tried to stop him  but vainly  he would go on  and say it all  Angry as she was  the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak  She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness  and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour  Accordingly  with a mixture of the serious and the playful  which she hoped would best suit his half and half state  she replied   I am very much astonished  Mr  Elton  This to _me_  you forget yourself  you take me for my friend  any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver  but no more of this to _me_  if you please   Miss Smith  message to Miss Smith  What could she possibly mean  And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent  such boastful pretence of amazement  that she could not help replying with quickness   Mr  Elton  this is the most extraordinary conduct  and I can account for it only in one way  you are not yourself  or you could not speak either to me  or of Harriet  in such a manner  Command yourself enough to say no more  and I will endeavour to forget it  But Mr  Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits  not at all to confuse his intellects  He perfectly knew his own meaning  and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious  and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend  but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all  he resumed the subject of his own passion  and was very urgent for a favourable answer  As she thought less of his inebriety  she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption  and with fewer struggles for politeness  replied   It is impossible for me to doubt any longer  You have made yourself too clear  Mr  Elton  my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express  After such behaviour  as I have witnessed during the last month  to Miss Smith  such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing  to be addressing me in this manner  this is an unsteadiness of character  indeed  which I had not supposed possible  Believe me  sir  I am far  very far  from gratified in being the object of such professions   Good Heaven  cried Mr  Elton   what can be the meaning of this  Miss Smith  I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence  never paid her any attentions  but as your friend  never cared whether she were dead or alive  but as your friend  If she has fancied otherwise  her own wishes have misled her  and I am very sorry  extremely sorry  But  Miss Smith  indeed  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  who can think of Miss Smith  when Miss Woodhouse is near  No  upon my honour  there is no unsteadiness of character  I have thought only of you  I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else  Every thing that I have said or done  for many weeks past  has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself  You cannot really  seriously  doubt it  No  in an accent meant to be insinuating  I am sure you have seen and understood me  It would be impossible to say what Emma felt  on hearing this  which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost  She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply  and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr  Elton  s sanguine state of mind  he tried to take her hand again  as he joyously exclaimed   Charming Miss Woodhouse  allow me to interpret this interesting silence  It confesses that you have long understood me   No  sir  cried Emma   it confesses no such thing  So far from having long understood you  I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views  till this moment  As to myself  I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings  Nothing could be farther from my wishes  your attachment to my friend Harriet  your pursuit of her   pursuit  it appeared  gave me great pleasure  and I have been very earnestly wishing you success  but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield  I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent  Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith  that you have never thought seriously of her   Never  madam  cried he  affronted in his turn   never  I assure you  _I_ think seriously of Miss Smith  Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl  and I should be happy to see her respectably settled  I wish her extremely well  and  no doubt  there are men who might not object to  Every body has their level  but as for myself  I am not  I think  quite so much at a loss  I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance  as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith  No  madam  my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only  and the encouragement I received   Encouragement  I give you encouragement  Sir  you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it  I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend  In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance  I am exceedingly sorry  but it is well that the mistake ends where it does  Had the same behaviour continued  Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views  not being aware  probably  any more than myself  of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of  But  as it is  the disappointment is single  and  I trust  will not be lasting  I have no thoughts of matrimony at present  He was too angry to say another word  her manner too decided to invite supplication  and in this state of swelling resentment  and mutually deep mortification  they had to continue together a few minutes longer  for the fears of Mr  Woodhouse had confined them to a foot  pace  If there had not been so much anger  there would have been desperate awkwardness  but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment  Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane  or when it stopped  they found themselves  all at once  at the door of his house  and he was out before another syllable passed  Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night  The compliment was just returned  coldly and proudly  and  under indescribable irritation of spirits  she was then conveyed to Hartfield  There she was welcomed  with the utmost delight  by her father  who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane  turning a corner which he could never bear to think of  and in strange hands  a mere common coachman  no James  and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well  for Mr  John Knightley  ashamed of his ill  humour  was now all kindness and attention  and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father  as to seem  if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel  perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome  and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party  except herself  But her mind had never been in such perturbation  and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection  CHAPTER XVI The hair was curled  and the maid sent away  and Emma sat down to think and be miserable  It was a wretched business indeed  Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for  Such a development of every thing most unwelcome  Such a blow for Harriet  that was the worst of all  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation  of some sort or other  but  compared with the evil to Harriet  all was light  and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken  more in error  more disgraced by mis  judgment  than she actually was  could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself   If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man  I could have borne any thing  He might have doubled his presumption to me  but poor Harriet  How she could have been so deceived  He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet  never  She looked back as well as she could  but it was all confusion  She had taken up the idea  she supposed  and made every thing bend to it  His manners  however  must have been unmarked  wavering  dubious  or she could not have been so misled  The picture  How eager he had been about the picture  and the charade  and an hundred other circumstances  how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet  To be sure  the charade  with its  ready wit  but then the  soft eyes  in fact it suited neither  it was a jumble without taste or truth  Who could have seen through such thick  headed nonsense  Certainly she had often  especially of late  thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant  but it had passed as his way  as a mere error of judgment  of knowledge  of taste  as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society  that with all the gentleness of his address  true elegance was sometimes wanting  but  till this very day  she had never  for an instant  suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet  s friend  To Mr  John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject  for the first start of its possibility  There was no denying that those brothers had penetration  She remembered what Mr  Knightley had once said to her about Mr  Elton  the caution he had given  the conviction he had professed that Mr  Elton would never marry indiscreetly  and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself  It was dreadfully mortifying  but Mr  Elton was proving himself  in many respects  the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him  proud  assuming  conceited  very full of his own claims  and little concerned about the feelings of others  Contrary to the usual course of things  Mr  Elton  s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion  His professions and his proposals did him no service  She thought nothing of his attachment  and was insulted by his hopes  He wanted to marry well  and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her  pretended to be in love  but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for  There had been no real affection either in his language or manners  Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance  but she could hardly devise any set of expressions  or fancy any tone of voice  less allied with real love  She need not trouble herself to pity him  He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself  and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield  the heiress of thirty thousand pounds  were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied  he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty  or with ten  But  that he should talk of encouragement  should consider her as aware of his views  accepting his attentions  meaning  in short  to marry him  should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind  look down upon her friend  so well understanding the gradations of rank below him  and be so blind to what rose above  as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her  It was most provoking  Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent  and all the elegancies of mind  The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it  but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior  He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield  the younger branch of a very ancient family  and that the Eltons were nobody  The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable  being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate  to which all the rest of Highbury belonged  but their fortune  from other sources  was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself  in every other kind of consequence  and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr  Elton had first entered not two years ago  to make his way as he could  without any alliances but in trade  or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility  But he had fancied her in love with him  that evidently must have been his dependence  and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head  Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging  so full of courtesy and attention  as  supposing her real motive unperceived  might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy  like Mr  Elton  in fancying himself a very decided favourite  If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings  she had little right to wonder that _he_  with self  interest to blind him  should have mistaken hers  The first error and the worst lay at her door  It was foolish  it was wrong  to take so active a part in bringing any two people together  It was adventuring too far  assuming too much  making light of what ought to be serious  a trick of what ought to be simple  She was quite concerned and ashamed  and resolved to do such things no more   Here have I  said she   actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man  She might never have thought of him but for me  and certainly never would have thought of him with hope  if I had not assured her of his attachment  for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him  Oh  that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin  There I was quite right  That was well done of me  but there I should have stopped  and left the rest to time and chance  I was introducing her into good company  and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having  I ought not to have attempted more  But now  poor girl  her peace is cut up for some time  I have been but half a friend to her  and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much  I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her  William Coxe  Oh  no  I could not endure William Coxe  a pert young lawyer  She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse  and then resumed a more serious  more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been  and might be  and must be  The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet  and all that poor Harriet would be suffering  with the awkwardness of future meetings  the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance  of subduing feelings  concealing resentment  and avoiding eclat  were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer  and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully  To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma  s  though under temporary gloom at night  the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits  The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy  and of powerful operation  and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed  they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope  Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed  more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her  and to depend on getting tolerably out of it  It was a great consolation that Mr  Elton should not be really in love with her  or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him  that Harriet  s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive  and that there could be no necessity for any body  s knowing what had passed except the three principals  and especially for her father  s being given a moment  s uneasiness about it  These were very cheering thoughts  and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service  for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present  The weather was most favourable for her  though Christmas Day  she could not go to church  Mr  Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it  and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas  The ground covered with snow  and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw  which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise  every morning beginning in rain or snow  and every evening setting in to freeze  she was for many days a most honourable prisoner  No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note  no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day  and no need to find excuses for Mr  Elton  s absenting himself  It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home  and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other  it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house  too wise to stir out  and to hear him say to Mr  Knightley  whom no weather could keep entirely from them   Ah  Mr  Knightley  why do not you stay at home like poor Mr  Elton  These days of confinement would have been  but for her private perplexities  remarkably comfortable  as such seclusion exactly suited her brother  whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions  and he had  besides  so thoroughly cleared off his ill  humour at Randalls  that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield  He was always agreeable and obliging  and speaking pleasantly of every body  But with all the hopes of cheerfulness  and all the present comfort of delay  there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet  as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease  CHAPTER XVII Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield  The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move  and Mr  Woodhouse having  as usual  tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children  was obliged to see the whole party set off  and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella  which poor Isabella  passing her life with those she doated on  full of their merits  blind to their faults  and always innocently busy  might have been a model of right feminine happiness  The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr  Elton to Mr  Woodhouse  a long  civil  ceremonious note  to say  with Mr  Elton  s best compliments   that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath  where  in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends  he had engaged to spend a few weeks  and very much regretted the impossibility he was under  from various circumstances of weather and business  of taking a personal leave of Mr  Woodhouse  of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense  and had Mr  Woodhouse any commands  should be happy to attend to them  Emma was most agreeably surprized  Mr  Elton  s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired  She admired him for contriving it  though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced  Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father  from which she was so pointedly excluded  She had not even a share in his opening compliments  Her name was not mentioned  and there was so striking a change in all this  and such an ill  judged solemnity of leave  taking in his graceful acknowledgments  as she thought  at first  could not escape her father  s suspicion  It did  however  Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey  and his fears that Mr  Elton might never get safely to the end of it  and saw nothing extraordinary in his language  It was a very useful note  for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening  Mr  Woodhouse talked over his alarms  and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude  She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark  She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold  and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman  s return  She went to Mrs  Goddard  s accordingly the very next day  to undergo the necessary penance of communication  and a severe one it was  She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding  to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred  and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis  judging in all her ideas on one subject  all her observations  all her convictions  all her prophecies for the last six weeks  The confession completely renewed her first shame  and the sight of Harriet  s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again  Harriet bore the intelligence very well  blaming nobody  and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself  as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend  Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost  and all that was amiable  all that ought to be attaching  seemed on Harriet  s side  not her own  Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of  The affection of such a man as Mr  Elton would have been too great a distinction  She never could have deserved him  and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible  Her tears fell abundantly  but her grief was so truly artless  that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma  s eyes  and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding  really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two  and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do  It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple  minded and ignorant  but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet  and repressing imagination all the rest of her life  Her second duty now  inferior only to her father  s claims  was to promote Harriet  s comfort  and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match  making  She got her to Hartfield  and shewed her the most unvarying kindness  striving to occupy and amuse her  and by books and conversation  to drive Mr  Elton from her thoughts  Time  she knew  must be allowed for this being thoroughly done  and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general  and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr  Elton in particular  but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet  s age  and with the entire extinction of all hope  such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr  Elton  s return  as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance  without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them  Harriet did think him all perfection  and maintained the non  existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did  in truth  prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen  but yet it appeared to her so natural  so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_  that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force  If Mr  Elton  on his return  made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do  she could not imagine Harriet  s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him  Their being fixed  so absolutely fixed  in the same place  was bad for each  for all three  Not one of them had the power of removal  or of effecting any material change of society  They must encounter each other  and make the best of it  Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs  Goddard  s  Mr  Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school  and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth  Where the wound had been given  there must the cure be found if anywhere  and Emma felt that  till she saw her in the way of cure  there could be no true peace for herself  CHAPTER XVIII Mr  Frank Churchill did not come  When the time proposed drew near  Mrs  Weston  s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse  For the present  he could not be spared  to his  very great mortification and regret  but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period  Mrs  Weston was exceedingly disappointed  much more disappointed  in fact  than her husband  though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober  but a sanguine temper  though for ever expecting more good than occurs  does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression  It soon flies over the present failure  and begins to hope again  For half an hour Mr  Weston was surprized and sorry  but then he began to perceive that Frank  s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan  better time of year  better weather  and that he would be able  without any doubt  to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner  These feelings rapidly restored his comfort  while Mrs  Weston  of a more apprehensive disposition  foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays  and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer  suffered a great deal more herself  Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr  Frank Churchill  s not coming  except as a disappointment at Randalls  The acquaintance at present had no charm for her  She wanted  rather  to be quiet  and out of temptation  but still  as it was desirable that she should appear  in general  like her usual self  she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance  and enter as warmly into Mr  and Mrs  Weston  s disappointment  as might naturally belong to their friendship  She was the first to announce it to Mr  Knightley  and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary   or  being acting a part  perhaps rather more  at the conduct of the Churchills  in keeping him away  She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt  of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry  the pleasure of looking at somebody new  the gala  day to Highbury entire  which the sight of him would have made  and ending with reflections on the Churchills again  found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr  Knightley  and  to her great amusement  perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion  and making use of Mrs  Weston  s arguments against herself   The Churchills are very likely in fault  said Mr  Knightley  coolly   but I dare say he might come if he would   I do not know why you should say so  He wishes exceedingly to come  but his uncle and aunt will not spare him   I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming  if he made a point of it  It is too unlikely  for me to believe it without proof   How odd you are  What has Mr  Frank Churchill done  to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature   I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature  in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions  and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure  from living with those who have always set him the example of it  It is a great deal more natural than one could wish  that a young man  brought up by those who are proud  luxurious  and selfish  should be proud  luxurious  and selfish too  If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father  he would have contrived it between September and January  A man at his age  what is he  three or four  and  twenty  cannot be without the means of doing as much as that  It is impossible   That  s easily said  and easily felt by you  who have always been your own master  You are the worst judge in the world  Mr  Knightley  of the difficulties of dependence  You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage   It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four  and  twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount  He cannot want money  he cannot want leisure  We know  on the contrary  that he has so much of both  that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom  We hear of him for ever at some watering  place or other  A little while ago  he was at Weymouth  This proves that he can leave the Churchills   Yes  sometimes he can   And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while  whenever there is any temptation of pleasure   It is very unfair to judge of any body  s conduct  without an intimate knowledge of their situation  Nobody  who has not been in the interior of a family  can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be  We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe  and with Mrs  Churchill  s temper  before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do  He may  at times  be able to do a great deal more than he can at others   There is one thing  Emma  which a man can always do  if he chuses  and that is  his duty  not by manoeuvring and finessing  but by vigour and resolution  It is Frank Churchill  s duty to pay this attention to his father  He knows it to be so  by his promises and messages  but if he wished to do it  it might be done  A man who felt rightly would say at once  simply and resolutely  to Mrs  Churchill  ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience  but I must go and see my father immediately  I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion  I shall  therefore  set off to  morrow  If he would say so to her at once  in the tone of decision becoming a man  there would be no opposition made to his going   No  said Emma  laughing   but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again  Such language for a young man entirely dependent  to use  Nobody but you  Mr  Knightley  would imagine it possible  But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own  Mr  Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt  who have brought him up  and are to provide for him  Standing up in the middle of the room  I suppose  and speaking as loud as he could  How can you imagine such conduct practicable   Depend upon it  Emma  a sensible man would find no difficulty in it  He would feel himself in the right  and the declaration  made  of course  as a man of sense would make it  in a proper manner  would do him more good  raise him higher  fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on  than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do  Respect would be added to affection  They would feel that they could trust him  that the nephew who had done rightly by his father  would do rightly by them  for they know  as well as he does  as well as all the world must know  that he ought to pay this visit to his father  and while meanly exerting their power to delay it  are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims  Respect for right conduct is felt by every body  If he would act in this sort of manner  on principle  consistently  regularly  their little minds would bend to his   I rather doubt that  You are very fond of bending little minds  but where little minds belong to rich people in authority  I think they have a knack of swelling out  till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones  I can imagine  that if you  as you are  Mr  Knightley  were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr  Frank Churchill  s situation  you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him  and it might have a very good effect  The Churchills might not have a word to say in return  but then  you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through  To him who has  it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence  and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought  He may have as strong a sense of what would be right  as you can have  without being so equal  under particular circumstances  to act up to it   Then it would not be so strong a sense  If it failed to produce equal exertion  it could not be an equal conviction   Oh  the difference of situation and habit  I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those  whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life   Our amiable young man is a very weak young man  if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others  It ought to have been a habit with him by this time  of following his duty  instead of consulting expediency  I can allow for the fears of the child  but not of the man  As he became rational  he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority  He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father  Had he begun as he ought  there would have been no difficulty now   We shall never agree about him  cried Emma   but that is nothing extraordinary  I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man  I feel sure that he is not  Mr  Weston would not be blind to folly  though in his own son  but he is very likely to have a more yielding  complying  mild disposition than would suit your notions of man  s perfection  I dare say he has  and though it may cut him off from some advantages  it will secure him many others   Yes  all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move  and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure  and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it  He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter  full of professions and falsehoods  and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father  s having any right to complain  His letters disgust me   Your feelings are singular  They seem to satisfy every body else   I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs  Weston  They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings  standing in a mother  s place  but without a mother  s affection to blind her  It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due  and she must doubly feel the omission  Had she been a person of consequence herself  he would have come I dare say  and it would not have signified whether he did or no  Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations  Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself  No  Emma  your amiable young man can be amiable only in French  not in English  He may be very ` aimable  have very good manners  and be very agreeable  but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people  nothing really amiable about him   You seem determined to think ill of him   Me  not at all  replied Mr  Knightley  rather displeased   I do not want to think ill of him  I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man  but I hear of none  except what are merely personal  that he is well  grown and good  looking  with smooth  plausible manners   Well  if he have nothing else to recommend him  he will be a treasure at Highbury  We do not often look upon fine young men  well  bred and agreeable  We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain  Cannot you imagine  Mr  Knightley  what a _sensation_ his coming will produce  There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury  but one interest  one object of curiosity  it will be all Mr  Frank Churchill  we shall think and speak of nobody else   You will excuse my being so much over  powered  If I find him conversable  I shall be glad of his acquaintance  but if he is only a chattering coxcomb  he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts   My idea of him is  that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body  and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable  To you  he will talk of farming  to me  of drawing or music  and so on to every body  having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead  or take the lead  just as propriety may require  and to speak extremely well on each  that is my idea of him   And mine  said Mr  Knightley warmly   is  that if he turn out any thing like it  he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing  What  at three  and  twenty to be the king of his company  the great man  the practised politician  who is to read every body  s character  and make every body  s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority  to be dispensing his flatteries around  that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself  My dear Emma  your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point   I will say no more about him  cried Emma   you turn every thing to evil  We are both prejudiced  you against  I for him  and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here   Prejudiced  I am not prejudiced   But I am very much  and without being at all ashamed of it  My love for Mr  and Mrs  Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour   He is a person I never think of from one month  s end to another  said Mr  Knightley  with a degree of vexation  which made Emma immediately talk of something else  though she could not comprehend why he should be angry  To take a dislike to a young man  only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself  was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him  for with all the high opinion of himself  which she had often laid to his charge  she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another  VOLUME II CHAPTER I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning  and  in Emma  s opinion  had been talking enough of Mr  Elton for that day  She could not think that Harriet  s solace or her own sins required more  and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned  but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded  and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter  and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive   Mr  Elton is so good to the poor  she found something else must be done  They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs  and Miss Bates  She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers  There was always sufficient reason for such an attention  Mrs  and Miss Bates loved to be called on  and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her  as rather negligent in that respect  and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts  She had had many a hint from Mr  Knightley and some from her own heart  as to her deficiency  but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable  a waste of time  tiresome women  and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second  rate and third  rate of Highbury  who were calling on them for ever  and therefore she seldom went near them  But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in  observing  as she proposed it to Harriet  that  as well as she could calculate  they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax  The house belonged to people in business  Mrs  and Miss Bates occupied the drawing  room floor  and there  in the very moderate  sized apartment  which was every thing to them  the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed  the quiet neat old lady  who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner  wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse  and her more active  talking daughter  almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness  thanks for their visit  solicitude for their shoes  anxious inquiries after Mr  Woodhouse  s health  cheerful communications about her mother  s  and sweet  cake from the beaufet  Mrs  Cole had just been there  just called in for ten minutes  and had been so good as to sit an hour with them  and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much  and  therefore  she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too  The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr  Elton  There was intimacy between them  and Mr  Cole had heard from Mr  Elton since his going away  Emma knew what was coming  they must have the letter over again  and settle how long he had been gone  and how much he was engaged in company  and what a favourite he was wherever he went  and how full the Master of the Ceremonies  ball had been  and she went through it very well  with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite  and always putting forward to prevent Harriet  s being obliged to say a word  This she had been prepared for when she entered the house  but meant  having once talked him handsomely over  to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic  and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury  and their card  parties  She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr  Elton  but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates  she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles  to usher in a letter from her niece   Oh  yes  Mr  Elton  I understand  certainly as to dancing  Mrs  Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was  Mrs  Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us  talking of Jane  for as soon as she came in  she began inquiring after her  Jane is so very great a favourite there  Whenever she is with us  Mrs  Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough  and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can  And so she began inquiring after her directly  saying  ` I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately  because it is not her time for writing  and when I immediately said  ` But indeed we have  we had a letter this very morning  I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized  ` Have you  upon your honour  said she  ` well  that is quite unexpected  Do let me hear what she says  Emma  s politeness was at hand directly  to say  with smiling interest   Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately  I am extremely happy  I hope she is well   Thank you  You are so kind  replied the happily deceived aunt  while eagerly hunting for the letter  Oh  here it is  I was sure it could not be far off  but I had put my huswife upon it  you see  without being aware  and so it was quite hid  but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table  I was reading it to Mrs  Cole  and since she went away  I was reading it again to my mother  for it is such a pleasure to her  a letter from Jane  that she can never hear it often enough  so I knew it could not be far off  and here it is  only just under my huswife  and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says  but  first of all  I really must  in justice to Jane  apologise for her writing so short a letter  only two pages you see  hardly two  and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half  My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well  She often says  when the letter is first opened  ` Well  Hetty  now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker  work  don  t you  ma  am  And then I tell her  I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself  if she had nobody to do it for her  every word of it  I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word  And  indeed  though my mother  s eyes are not so good as they were  she can see amazingly well still  thank God  with the help of spectacles  It is such a blessing  My mother  s are really very good indeed  Jane often says  when she is here  ` I am sure  grandmama  you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do  and so much fine work as you have done too  I only wish my eyes may last me as well  All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath  and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax  s handwriting   You are extremely kind  replied Miss Bates  highly gratified   you who are such a judge  and write so beautifully yourself  I am sure there is nobody  s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse  s  My mother does not hear  she is a little deaf you know  Ma  am  addressing her   do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane  s handwriting  And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it  She was pondering  in the meanwhile  upon the possibility  without seeming very rude  of making her escape from Jane Fairfax  s letter  and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse  when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention   My mother  s deafness is very trifling you see  just nothing at all  By only raising my voice  and saying any thing two or three times over  she is sure to hear  but then she is used to my voice  But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me  Jane speaks so distinct  However  she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago  which is saying a great deal at my mother  s time of life  and it really is full two years  you know  since she was here  We never were so long without seeing her before  and as I was telling Mrs  Cole  we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now   Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon   Oh yes  next week   Indeed  that must be a very great pleasure   Thank you  You are very kind  Yes  next week  Every body is so surprized  and every body says the same obliging things  I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury  as they can be to see her  Yes  Friday or Saturday  she cannot say which  because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days  So very good of them to send her the whole way  But they always do  you know  Oh yes  Friday or Saturday next  That is what she writes about  That is the reason of her writing out of rule  as we call it  for  in the common course  we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday   Yes  so I imagined  I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to  day   So obliging of you  No  we should not have heard  if it had not been for this particular circumstance  of her being to come here so soon  My mother is so delighted  for she is to be three months with us at least  Three months  she says so  positively  as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you  The case is  you see  that the Campbells are going to Ireland  Mrs  Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly  They had not intended to go over till the summer  but she is so impatient to see them again  for till she married  last October  she was never away from them so much as a week  which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms  I was going to say  but however different countries  and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother  or her father  I declare I do not know which it was  but we shall see presently in Jane  s letter  wrote in Mr  Dixon  s name as well as her own  to press their coming over directly  and they would give them the meeting in Dublin  and take them back to their country seat  Baly  craig  a beautiful place  I fancy  Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty  from Mr  Dixon  I mean  I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else  but it was very natural  you know  that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses  and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them  for Colonel and Mrs  Campbell were very particular about their daughter  s not walking out often with only Mr  Dixon  for which I do not at all blame them  of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland  and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place  views that he had taken himself  He is a most amiable  charming young man  I believe  Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland  from his account of things  At this moment  an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma  s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax  this charming Mr  Dixon  and the not going to Ireland  she said  with the insidious design of farther discovery   You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time  Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs  Dixon  you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs  Campbell   Very true  very true  indeed  The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of  for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us  for months together  not able to come if any thing was to happen  But you see  every thing turns out for the best  They want her  Mr  and Mrs  Dixon  excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs  Campbell  quite depend upon it  nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation  Jane says  as you will hear presently  Mr  Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention  He is a most charming young man  Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth  when they were out in that party on the water  and she  by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails  would have been dashed into the sea at once  and actually was all but gone  if he had not  with the greatest presence of mind  caught hold of her habit   I can never think of it without trembling  But ever since we had the history of that day  I have been so fond of Mr  Dixon   But  in spite of all her friends  urgency  and her own wish of seeing Ireland  Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs  Bates   Yes  entirely her own doing  entirely her own choice  and Colonel and Mrs  Campbell think she does quite right  just what they should recommend  and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air  as she has not been quite so well as usual lately   I am concerned to hear of it  I think they judge wisely  But Mrs  Dixon must be very much disappointed  Mrs  Dixon  I understand  has no remarkable degree of personal beauty  is not  by any means  to be compared with Miss Fairfax   Oh  no  You are very obliging to say such things  but certainly not  There is no comparison between them  Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain  but extremely elegant and amiable   Yes  that of course   Jane caught a bad cold  poor thing  so long ago as the th of November   as I am going to read to you  and has never been well since  A long time  is not it  for a cold to hang upon her  She never mentioned it before  because she would not alarm us  Just like her  so considerate  But however  she is so far from well  that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home  and try an air that always agrees with her  and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her  and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here  than go to Ireland  if she is unwell  Nobody could nurse her  as we should do   It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world   And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday  and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following  as you will find from Jane  s letter  So sudden  You may guess  dear Miss Woodhouse  what a flurry it has thrown me in  If it was not for the drawback of her illness  but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin  and looking very poorly  I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me  as to that  I always make a point of reading Jane  s letters through to myself first  before I read them aloud to my mother  you know  for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her  Jane desired me to do it  so I always do  and so I began to  day with my usual caution  but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell  than I burst out  quite frightened  with ` Bless me  poor Jane is ill  which my mother  being on the watch  heard distinctly  and was sadly alarmed at  However  when I read on  I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first  and I make so light of it now to her  that she does not think much about it  But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard  If Jane does not get well soon  we will call in Mr  Perry  The expense shall not be thought of  and though he is so liberal  and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance  we could not suffer it to be so  you know  He has a wife and family to maintain  and is not to be giving away his time  Well  now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about  we will turn to her letter  and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her   I am afraid we must be running away  said Emma  glancing at Harriet  and beginning to rise  My father will be expecting us  I had no intention  I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes  when I first entered the house  I merely called  because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs  Bates  but I have been so pleasantly detained  Now  however  we must wish you and Mrs  Bates good morning  And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded  She regained the street  happy in this  that though much had been forced on her against her will  though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax  s letter  she had been able to escape the letter itself  CHAPTER II Jane Fairfax was an orphan  the only child of Mrs  Bates  s youngest daughter  The marriage of Lieut  Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry  and Miss Jane Bates  had had its day of fame and pleasure  hope and interest  but nothing now remained of it  save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad  of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards  and this girl  By birth she belonged to Highbury  and when at three years old  on losing her mother  she became the property  the charge  the consolation  the fondling of her grandmother and aunt  there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there  of her being taught only what very limited means could command  and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement  to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person  good understanding  and warm  hearted  well  meaning relations  But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny  This was Colonel Campbell  who had very highly regarded Fairfax  as an excellent officer and most deserving young man  and farther  had been indebted to him for such attentions  during a severe camp  fever  as he believed had saved his life  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook  though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax  before his own return to England put any thing in his power  When he did return  he sought out the child and took notice of her  He was a married man  with only one living child  a girl  about Jane  s age  and Jane became their guest  paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all  and before she was nine years old  his daughter  s great fondness for her  and his own wish of being a real friend  united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education  It was accepted  and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell  s family  and had lived with them entirely  only visiting her grandmother from time to time  The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others  the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible  To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell  s power  for though his income  by pay and appointments  was handsome  his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter  s  but  by giving her an education  he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter  Such was Jane Fairfax  s history  She had fallen into good hands  known nothing but kindness from the Campbells  and been given an excellent education  Living constantly with right  minded and well  informed people  her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture  and Colonel Campbell  s residence being in London  every lighter talent had been done full justice to  by the attendance of first  rate masters  Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do  and at eighteen or nineteen she was  as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children  fully competent to the office of instruction herself  but she was too much beloved to be parted with  Neither father nor mother could promote  and the daughter could not endure it  The evil day was put off  It was easy to decide that she was still too young  and Jane remained with them  sharing  as another daughter  in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society  and a judicious mixture of home and amusement  with only the drawback of the future  the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over  The affection of the whole family  the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular  was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane  s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements  That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman  nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents  They continued together with unabated regard however  till the marriage of Miss Campbell  who by that chance  that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs  giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior  engaged the affections of Mr  Dixon  a young man  rich and agreeable  almost as soon as they were acquainted  and was eligibly and happily settled  while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn  This event had very lately taken place  too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty  though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning  She had long resolved that one  and  twenty should be the period  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate  she had resolved at one  and  twenty to complete the sacrifice  and retire from all the pleasures of life  of rational intercourse  equal society  peace and hope  to penance and mortification for ever  The good sense of Colonel and Mrs  Campbell could not oppose such a resolution  though their feelings did  As long as they lived  no exertions would be necessary  their home might be hers for ever  and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly  but this would be selfishness  what must be at last  had better be soon  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay  and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished  Still  however  affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment  She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter  s marriage  and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength  they must forbid her engaging in duties  which  so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits  seemed  under the most favourable circumstances  to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort  With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland  her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth  though there might be some truths not told  It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury  to spend  perhaps  her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear  and the Campbells  whatever might be their motive or motives  whether single  or double  or treble  gave the arrangement their ready sanction  and said  that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air  for the recovery of her health  than on any thing else  Certain it was that she was to come  and that Highbury  instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it  Mr  Frank Churchill  must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax  who could bring only the freshness of a two years  absence  Emma was sorry  to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months  to be always doing more than she wished  and less than she ought  Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer  Mr  Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman  which she wanted to be thought herself  and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time  there were moments of self  examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her  But  she could never get acquainted with her  she did not know how it was  but there was such coldness and reserve  such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not  and then  her aunt was such an eternal talker  and she was made such a fuss with by every body  and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate  because their ages were the same  every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other  These were her reasons  she had no better  It was a dislike so little just  every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy  that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence  without feeling that she had injured her  and now  when the due visit was paid  on her arrival  after a two years  interval  she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners  which for those two whole years she had been depreciating  Jane Fairfax was very elegant  remarkably elegant  and she had herself the highest value for elegance  Her height was pretty  just such as almost every body would think tall  and nobody could think very tall  her figure particularly graceful  her size a most becoming medium  between fat and thin  though a slight appearance of ill  health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two  Emma could not but feel all this  and then  her face  her features  there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered  it was not regular  but it was very pleasing beauty  Her eyes  a deep grey  with dark eye  lashes and eyebrows  had never been denied their praise  but the skin  which she had been used to cavil at  as wanting colour  had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom  It was a style of beauty  of which elegance was the reigning character  and as such  she must  in honour  by all her principles  admire it  elegance  which  whether of person or of mind  she saw so little in Highbury  There  not to be vulgar  was distinction  and merit  In short  she sat  during the first visit  looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency  the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice  and was determining that she would dislike her no longer  When she took in her history  indeed  her situation  as well as her beauty  when she considered what all this elegance was destined to  what she was going to sink from  how she was going to live  it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect  especially  if to every well  known particular entitling her to interest  were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr  Dixon  which she had so naturally started to herself  In that case  nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on  Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr  Dixon  s actions from his wife  or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first  If it were love  it might be simple  single  successless love on her side alone  She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison  while a sharer of his conversation with her friend  and from the best  the purest of motives  might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland  and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty  Upon the whole  Emma left her with such softened  charitable feelings  as made her look around in walking home  and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence  nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her  These were charming feelings  but not lasting  Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax  or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors  than saying to Mr  Knightley   She certainly is handsome  she is better than handsome  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt  and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state  Former provocations reappeared  The aunt was as tiresome as ever  more tiresome  because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers  and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast  and how small a slice of mutton for dinner  as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself  and Jane  s offences rose again  They had music  Emma was obliged to play  and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour  an air of greatness  meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance  She was  besides  which was the worst of all  so cold  so cautious  There was no getting at her real opinion  Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness  she seemed determined to hazard nothing  She was disgustingly  was suspiciously reserved  If any thing could be more  where all was most  she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing  She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr  Dixon  s character  or her own value for his company  or opinion of the suitableness of the match  It was all general approbation and smoothness  nothing delineated or distinguished  It did her no service however  Her caution was thrown away  Emma saw its artifice  and returned to her first surmises  There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference  Mr  Dixon  perhaps  had been very near changing one friend for the other  or been fixed only to Miss Campbell  for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds  The like reserve prevailed on other topics  She and Mr  Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time  It was known that they were a little acquainted  but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was   Was he handsome  She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man   Was he agreeable   He was generally thought so   Did he appear a sensible young man  a young man of information  At a watering  place  or in a common London acquaintance  it was difficult to decide on such points  Manners were all that could be safely judged of  under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr  Churchill  She believed every body found his manners pleasing  Emma could not forgive her  CHAPTER III Emma could not forgive her  but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr  Knightley  who had been of the party  and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side  he was expressing the next morning  being at Hartfield again on business with Mr  Woodhouse  his approbation of the whole  not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room  but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma  He had been used to think her unjust to Jane  and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement   A very pleasant evening  he began  as soon as Mr  Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary  told that he understood  and the papers swept away  particularly pleasant  You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music  I do not know a more luxurious state  sir  than sitting at one  s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women  sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation  I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant  Emma  You left nothing undone  I was glad you made her play so much  for having no instrument at her grandmother  s  it must have been a real indulgence   I am happy you approved  said Emma  smiling   but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield   No  my dear  said her father instantly   _that_ I am sure you are not  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are  If any thing  you are too attentive  The muffin last night  if it had been handed round once  I think it would have been enough   No  said Mr  Knightley  nearly at the same time   you are not often deficient  not often deficient either in manner or comprehension  I think you understand me  therefore  An arch look expressed  I understand you well enough  but she said only   Miss Fairfax is reserved   I always told you she was  a little  but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome  all that has its foundation in diffidence  What arises from discretion must be honoured   You think her diffident  I do not see it   My dear Emma  said he  moving from his chair into one close by her   you are not going to tell me  I hope  that you had not a pleasant evening   Oh  no  I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions  and amused to think how little information I obtained   I am disappointed  was his only answer   I hope every body had a pleasant evening  said Mr  Woodhouse  in his quiet way   I had  Once  I felt the fire rather too much  but then I moved back my chair a little  a very little  and it did not disturb me  Miss Bates was very chatty and good  humoured  as she always is  though she speaks rather too quick  However  she is very agreeable  and Mrs  Bates too  in a different way  I like old friends  and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady  a very pretty and a very well  behaved young lady indeed  She must have found the evening agreeable  Mr  Knightley  because she had Emma   True  sir  and Emma  because she had Miss Fairfax  Emma saw his anxiety  and wishing to appease it  at least for the present  said  and with a sincerity which no one could question   She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one  s eyes from  I am always watching her to admire  and I do pity her from my heart  Mr  Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express  and before he could make any reply  Mr  Woodhouse  whose thoughts were on the Bates  s  said   It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined  a great pity indeed  and I have often wished  but it is so little one can venture to do  small  trifling presents  of any thing uncommon  Now we have killed a porker  and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg  it is very small and delicate  Hartfield pork is not like any other pork  but still it is pork  and  my dear Emma  unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks  nicely fried  as ours are fried  without the smallest grease  and not roast it  for no stomach can bear roast pork  I think we had better send the leg  do not you think so  my dear   My dear papa  I sent the whole hind  quarter  I knew you would wish it  There will be the leg to be salted  you know  which is so very nice  and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like   That  s right  my dear  very right  I had not thought of it before  but that is the best way  They must not over  salt the leg  and then  if it is not over  salted  and if it is very thoroughly boiled  just as Serle boils ours  and eaten very moderately of  with a boiled turnip  and a little carrot or parsnip  I do not consider it unwholesome   Emma  said Mr  Knightley presently   I have a piece of news for you  You like news  and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you   News  Oh  yes  I always like news  What is it  why do you smile so  where did you hear it  at Randalls  He had time only to say   No  not at Randalls  I have not been near Randalls  when the door was thrown open  and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room  Full of thanks  and full of news  Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest  Mr  Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment  and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him   Oh  my dear sir  how are you this morning  My dear Miss Woodhouse  I come quite over  powered  Such a beautiful hind  quarter of pork  You are too bountiful  Have you heard the news  Mr  Elton is going to be married  Emma had not had time even to think of Mr  Elton  and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start  and a little blush  at the sound   There is my news  I thought it would interest you  said Mr  Knightley  with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them   But where could _you_ hear it  cried Miss Bates   Where could you possibly hear it  Mr  Knightley  For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs  Cole  s note  no  it cannot be more than five  or at least ten  for I had got my bonnet and spencer on  just ready to come out  I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork  Jane was standing in the passage  were not you  Jane  for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting  pan large enough  So I said I would go down and see  and Jane said  ` Shall I go down instead  for I think you have a little cold  and Patty has been washing the kitchen --` Oh  my dear  said I  well  and just then came the note  A Miss Hawkins  that  s all I know  A Miss Hawkins of Bath  But  Mr  Knightley  how could you possibly have heard it  for the very moment Mr  Cole told Mrs  Cole of it  she sat down and wrote to me  A Miss Hawkins   I was with Mr  Cole on business an hour and a half ago  He had just read Elton  s letter as I was shewn in  and handed it to me directly   Well  that is quite  I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting  My dear sir  you really are too bountiful  My mother desires her very best compliments and regards  and a thousand thanks  and says you really quite oppress her   We consider our Hartfield pork  replied Mr  Woodhouse  indeed it certainly is  so very superior to all other pork  that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than   Oh  my dear sir  as my mother says  our friends are only too good to us  If ever there were people who  without having great wealth themselves  had every thing they could wish for  I am sure it is us  We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage  Well  Mr  Knightley  and so you actually saw the letter  well   It was short  merely to announce  but cheerful  exulting  of course  Here was a sly glance at Emma   He had been so fortunate as to  I forget the precise words  one has no business to remember them  The information was  as you state  that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins  By his style  I should imagine it just settled   Mr  Elton going to be married  said Emma  as soon as she could speak   He will have every body  s wishes for his happiness   He is very young to settle  was Mr  Woodhouse  s observation   He had better not be in a hurry  He seemed to me very well off as he was  We were always glad to see him at Hartfield   A new neighbour for us all  Miss Woodhouse  said Miss Bates  joyfully   my mother is so pleased  she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress  This is great news  indeed  Jane  you have never seen Mr  Elton  no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him  Jane  s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her   No  I have never seen Mr  Elton  she replied  starting on this appeal   is he  is he a tall man   Who shall answer that question  cried Emma   My father would say ` yes  Mr  Knightley ` no  and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium  When you have been here a little longer  Miss Fairfax  you will understand that Mr  Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury  both in person and mind   Very true  Miss Woodhouse  so she will  He is the very best young man  But  my dear Jane  if you remember  I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr  Perry  Miss Hawkins  I dare say  an excellent young woman  His extreme attention to my mother  wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew  that she might hear the better  for my mother is a little deaf  you know  it is not much  but she does not hear quite quick  Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf  He fancied bathing might be good for it  the warm bath  but she says it did him no lasting benefit  Colonel Campbell  you know  is quite our angel  And Mr  Dixon seems a very charming young man  quite worthy of him  It is such a happiness when good people get together  and they always do  Now  here will be Mr  Elton and Miss Hawkins  and there are the Coles  such very good people  and the Perrys  I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr  and Mrs  Perry  I say  sir  turning to Mr  Woodhouse   I think there are few places with such society as Highbury  I always say  we are quite blessed in our neighbours  My dear sir  if there is one thing my mother loves better than another  it is pork  a roast loin of pork   As to who  or what Miss Hawkins is  or how long he has been acquainted with her  said Emma   nothing I suppose can be known  One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance  He has been gone only four weeks  Nobody had any information to give  and  after a few more wonderings  Emma said   You are silent  Miss Fairfax  but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news  You  who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects  who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell  s account  we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr  Elton and Miss Hawkins   When I have seen Mr  Elton  replied Jane   I dare say I shall be interested  but I believe it requires _that_ with me  And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married  the impression may be a little worn off   Yes  he has been gone just four weeks  as you observe  Miss Woodhouse  said Miss Bates   four weeks yesterday  A Miss Hawkins  Well  I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts  not that I ever  Mrs  Cole once whispered to me  but I immediately said  ` No  Mr  Elton is a most worthy young man  but  In short  I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries  I do not pretend to it  What is before me  I see  At the same time  nobody could wonder if Mr  Elton should have aspired  Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on  so good  humouredly  She knows I would not offend for the world  How does Miss Smith do  She seems quite recovered now  Have you heard from Mrs  John Knightley lately  Oh  those dear little children  Jane  do you know I always fancy Mr  Dixon like Mr  John Knightley  I mean in person  tall  and with that sort of look  and not very talkative   Quite wrong  my dear aunt  there is no likeness at all   Very odd  but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand  One takes up a notion  and runs away with it  Mr  Dixon  you say  is not  strictly speaking  handsome   Handsome  Oh  no  far from it  certainly plain  I told you he was plain   My dear  you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain  and that you yourself   Oh  as for me  my judgment is worth nothing  Where I have a regard  I always think a person well  looking  But I gave what I believed the general opinion  when I called him plain   Well  my dear Jane  I believe we must be running away  The weather does not look well  and grandmama will be uneasy  You are too obliging  my dear Miss Woodhouse  but we really must take leave  This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed  I shall just go round by Mrs  Cole  s  but I shall not stop three minutes  and  Jane  you had better go home directly  I would not have you out in a shower  We think she is the better for Highbury already  Thank you  we do indeed  I shall not attempt calling on Mrs  Goddard  for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork  when we dress the leg it will be another thing  Good morning to you  my dear sir  Oh  Mr  Knightley is coming too  Well  that is so very  I am sure if Jane is tired  you will be so kind as to give her your arm  Mr  Elton  and Miss Hawkins  Good morning to you  Emma  alone with her father  had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry  and to marry strangers too  and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject  It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news  as proving that Mr  Elton could not have suffered long  but she was sorry for Harriet  Harriet must feel it  and all that she could hope was  by giving the first information herself  to save her from hearing it abruptly from others  It was now about the time that she was likely to call  If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way  and upon its beginning to rain  Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs  Goddard  s  and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation  The shower was heavy  but short  and it had not been over five minutes  when in came Harriet  with just the heated  agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give  and the  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  what do you think has happened  which instantly burst forth  had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation  As the blow was given  Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening  and Harriet  unchecked  ran eagerly through what she had to tell   She had set out from Mrs  Goddard  s half an hour ago  she had been afraid it would rain  she had been afraid it would pour down every moment  but she thought she might get to Hartfield first  she had hurried on as fast as possible  but then  as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her  she thought she would just step in and see how it went on  and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there  soon after she came out it began to rain  and she did not know what to do  so she ran on directly  as fast as she could  and took shelter at Ford  s  Ford  s was the principal woollen  draper  linen  draper  and haberdasher  s shop united  the shop first in size and fashion in the place  And so  there she had set  without an idea of any thing in the world  full ten minutes  perhaps  when  all of a sudden  who should come in  to be sure it was so very odd  but they always dealt at Ford  s  who should come in  but Elizabeth Martin and her brother  Dear Miss Woodhouse  only think  I thought I should have fainted  I did not know what to do  I was sitting near the door  Elizabeth saw me directly  but he did not  he was busy with the umbrella  I am sure she saw me  but she looked away directly  and took no notice  and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop  and I kept sitting near the door  Oh  dear  I was so miserable  I am sure I must have been as white as my gown  I could not go away you know  because of the rain  but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there  Oh  dear  Miss Woodhouse  well  at last  I fancy  he looked round and saw me  for instead of going on with her buyings  they began whispering to one another  I am sure they were talking of me  and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me  do you think he was  Miss Woodhouse  for presently she came forward  came quite up to me  and asked me how I did  and seemed ready to shake hands  if I would  She did not do any of it in the same way that she used  I could see she was altered  but  however  she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly  and we shook hands  and stood talking some time  but I know no more what I said  I was in such a tremble  I remember she said she was sorry we never met now  which I thought almost too kind  Dear  Miss Woodhouse  I was absolutely miserable  By that time  it was beginning to hold up  and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away  and then  only think  I found he was coming up towards me too  slowly you know  and as if he did not quite know what to do  and so he came and spoke  and I answered  and I stood for a minute  feeling dreadfully  you know  one can  t tell how  and then I took courage  and said it did not rain  and I must go  and so off I set  and I had not got three yards from the door  when he came after me  only to say  if I was going to Hartfield  he thought I had much better go round by Mr  Cole  s stables  for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain  Oh  dear  I thought it would have been the death of me  So I said  I was very much obliged to him  you know I could not do less  and then he went back to Elizabeth  and I came round by the stables  I believe I did  but I hardly knew where I was  or any thing about it  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  I would rather done any thing than have it happen  and yet  you know  there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly  And Elizabeth  too  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  do talk to me and make me comfortable again  Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so  but it was not immediately in her power  She was obliged to stop and think  She was not thoroughly comfortable herself  The young man  s conduct  and his sister  s  seemed the result of real feeling  and she could not but pity them  As Harriet described it  there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour  But she had believed them to be well  meaning  worthy people before  and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion  It was folly to be disturbed by it  Of course  he must be sorry to lose her  they must be all sorry  Ambition  as well as love  had probably been mortified  They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet  s acquaintance  and besides  what was the value of Harriet  s description  So easily pleased  so little discerning  what signified her praise  She exerted herself  and did try to make her comfortable  by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle  and quite unworthy of being dwelt on   It might be distressing  for the moment  said she   but you seem to have behaved extremely well  and it is over  and may never  can never  as a first meeting  occur again  and therefore you need not think about it  Harriet said   very true  and she  would not think about it  but still she talked of it  still she could talk of nothing else  and Emma  at last  in order to put the Martins out of her head  was obliged to hurry on the news  which she had meant to give with so much tender caution  hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry  ashamed or only amused  at such a state of mind in poor Harriet  such a conclusion of Mr  Elton  s importance with her  Mr  Elton  s rights  however  gradually revived  Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before  or an hour before  its interest soon increased  and before their first conversation was over  she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity  wonder and regret  pain and pleasure  as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins  which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy  Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting  It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock  without retaining any influence to alarm  As Harriet now lived  the Martins could not get at her  without seeking her  where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her  for since her refusal of the brother  the sisters never had been at Mrs  Goddard  s  and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again  with any necessity  or even any power of speech  CHAPTER IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations  that a young person  who either marries or dies  is sure of being kindly spoken of  A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins  s name was first mentioned in Highbury  before she was  by some means or other  discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind  to be handsome  elegant  highly accomplished  and perfectly amiable  and when Mr  Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects  and circulate the fame of her merits  there was very little more for him to do  than to tell her Christian name  and say whose music she principally played  Mr  Elton returned  a very happy man  He had gone away rejected and mortified  disappointed in a very sanguine hope  after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement  and not only losing the right lady  but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one  He had gone away deeply offended  he came back engaged to another  and to another as superior  of course  to the first  as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost  He came back gay and self  satisfied  eager and busy  caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse  and defying Miss Smith  The charming Augusta Hawkins  in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit  was in possession of an independent fortune  of so many thousands as would always be called ten  a point of some dignity  as well as some convenience  the story told well  he had not thrown himself away  he had gained a woman of 0  000 l  or thereabouts  and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity  the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice  the history which he had to give Mrs  Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious  the steps so quick  from the accidental rencontre  to the dinner at Mr  Green  s  and the party at Mrs  Brown  s  smiles and blushes rising in importance  with consciousness and agitation richly scattered  the lady had been so easily impressed  so sweetly disposed  had in short  to use a most intelligible phrase  been so very ready to have him  that vanity and prudence were equally contented  He had caught both substance and shadow  both fortune and affection  and was just the happy man he ought to be  talking only of himself and his own concerns  expecting to be congratulated  ready to be laughed at  and  with cordial  fearless smiles  now addressing all the young ladies of the place  to whom  a few weeks ago  he would have been more cautiously gallant  The wedding was no distant event  as the parties had only themselves to please  and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for  and when he set out for Bath again  there was a general expectation  which a certain glance of Mrs  Cole  s did not seem to contradict  that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride  During his present short stay  Emma had barely seen him  but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over  and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension  now spread over his air  She was  in fact  beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all  and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings  that  except in a moral light  as a penance  a lesson  a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind  she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again  She wished him very well  but he gave her pain  and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction  The pain of his continued residence in Highbury  however  must certainly be lessened by his marriage  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented  many awkwardnesses smoothed by it  A _Mrs  _ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse  former intimacy might sink without remark  It would be almost beginning their life of civility again  Of the lady  individually  Emma thought very little  She was good enough for Mr  Elton  no doubt  accomplished enough for Highbury  handsome enough  to look plain  probably  by Harriet  s side  As to connexion  there Emma was perfectly easy  persuaded  that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet  he had done nothing  On that article  truth seemed attainable  _What_ she was  must be uncertain  but _who_ she was  might be found out  and setting aside the 0  000 l  it did not appear that she was at all Harriet  s superior  She brought no name  no blood  no alliance  Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol  merchant  of course  he must be called  but  as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate  it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath  but Bristol was her home  the very heart of Bristol  for though the father and mother had died some years ago  an uncle remained  in the law line  nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him  than that he was in the law line  and with him the daughter had lived  Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney  and too stupid to rise  And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister  who was _very_ _well_ _married_  to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_  near Bristol  who kept two carriages  That was the wind  up of the history  that was the glory of Miss Hawkins  Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all  She had talked her into love  but  alas  she was not so easily to be talked out of it  The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet  s mind was not to be talked away  He might be superseded by another  he certainly would indeed  nothing could be clearer  even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient  but nothing else  she feared  would cure her  Harriet was one of those  who  having once begun  would be always in love  And now  poor girl  she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr  Elton  She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other  Emma saw him only once  but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him  or _just_ to miss him  _just_ to hear his voice  or see his shoulder  _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy  in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture  She was  moreover  perpetually hearing about him  for  excepting when at Hartfield  she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr  Elton  and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns  and every report  therefore  every guess  all that had already occurred  all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs  comprehending income  servants  and furniture  was continually in agitation around her  Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him  and her regrets kept alive  and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins  s happiness  and continual observation of  how much he seemed attached  his air as he walked by the house  the very sitting of his hat  being all in proof of how much he was in love  Had it been allowable entertainment  had there been no pain to her friend  or reproach to herself  in the waverings of Harriet  s mind  Emma would have been amused by its variations  Sometimes Mr  Elton predominated  sometimes the Martins  and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other  Mr  Elton  s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr  Martin  The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin  s calling at Mrs  Goddard  s a few days afterwards  Harriet had not been at home  but a note had been prepared and left for her  written in the very style to touch  a small mixture of reproach  with a great deal of kindness  and till Mr  Elton himself appeared  she had been much occupied by it  continually pondering over what could be done in return  and wishing to do more than she dared to confess  But Mr  Elton  in person  had driven away all such cares  While he staid  the Martins were forgotten  and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again  Emma  to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned  judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin  s visit  How that visit was to be acknowledged  what would be necessary  and what might be safest  had been a point of some doubtful consideration  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters  when invited to come  would be ingratitude  It must not be  and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance  After much thinking  she could determine on nothing better  than Harriet  s returning the visit  but in a way that  if they had understanding  should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance  She meant to take her in the carriage  leave her at the Abbey Mill  while she drove a little farther  and call for her again so soon  as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past  and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future  She could think of nothing better  and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve  something of ingratitude  merely glossed over  it must be done  or what would become of Harriet  CHAPTER V Small heart had Harriet for visiting  Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs  Goddard  s  her evil stars had led her to the very spot where  at that moment  a trunk  directed to _The_ _Rev  _ _Philip_ _Elton_  _White  Hart_  _Bath_  was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher  s cart  which was to convey it to where the coaches past  and every thing in this world  excepting that trunk and the direction  was consequently a blank  She went  however  and when they reached the farm  and she was to be put down  at the end of the broad  neat gravel walk  which led between espalier apple  trees to the front door  the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before  was beginning to revive a little local agitation  and when they parted  Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity  which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour  She went on herself  to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married  and settled in Donwell  The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again  and Miss Smith receiving her summons  was with her without delay  and unattended by any alarming young man  She came solitarily down the gravel walk  a Miss Martin just appearing at the door  and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility  Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account  She was feeling too much  but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting  and the sort of pain it was creating  She had seen only Mrs  Martin and the two girls  They had received her doubtingly  if not coolly  and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time  till just at last  when Mrs  Martin  s saying  all of a sudden  that she thought Miss Smith was grown  had brought on a more interesting subject  and a warmer manner  In that very room she had been measured last September  with her two friends  There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window  _He_ had done it  They all seemed to remember the day  the hour  the party  the occasion  to feel the same consciousness  the same regrets  to be ready to return to the same good understanding  and they were just growing again like themselves   Harriet  as Emma must suspect  as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy  when the carriage reappeared  and all was over  The style of the visit  and the shortness of it  were then felt to be decisive  Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago  Emma could not but picture it all  and feel how justly they might resent  how naturally Harriet must suffer  It was a bad business  She would have given a great deal  or endured a great deal  to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life  They were so deserving  that a _little_ higher should have been enough  but as it was  how could she have done otherwise  Impossible  She could not repent  They must be separated  but there was a great deal of pain in the process  so much to herself at this time  that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation  and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it  Her mind was quite sick of Mr  Elton and the Martins  The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary  It was a good scheme  but on driving to the door they heard that neither  master nor mistress was at home  they had both been out some time  the man believed they were gone to Hartfield   This is too bad  cried Emma  as they turned away   And now we shall just miss them  too provoking  I do not know when I have been so disappointed  And she leaned back in the corner  to indulge her murmurs  or to reason them away  probably a little of both  such being the commonest process of a not ill  disposed mind  Presently the carriage stopt  she looked up  it was stopt by Mr  and Mrs  Weston  who were standing to speak to her  There was instant pleasure in the sight of them  and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound  for Mr  Weston immediately accosted her with   How d  ye do  how d  ye do  We have been sitting with your father  glad to see him so well  Frank comes to  morrow  I had a letter this morning  we see him to  morrow by dinner  time to a certainty  he is at Oxford to  day  and he comes for a whole fortnight  I knew it would be so  If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days  I was always glad he did not come at Christmas  now we are going to have just the right weather for him  fine  dry  settled weather  We shall enjoy him completely  every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish  There was no resisting such news  no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr  Weston  s  confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife  fewer and quieter  but not less to the purpose  To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so  and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy  It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits  The worn  out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming  and in the rapidity of half a moment  s thought  she hoped Mr  Elton would now be talked of no more  Mr  Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe  which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command  as well as the route and the method of his journey  and she listened  and smiled  and congratulated   I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield  said he  at the conclusion  Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech  from his wife   We had better move on  Mr  Weston  said she   we are detaining the girls   Well  well  I am ready  and turning again to Emma   but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man  you have only had _my_ account you know  I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary  though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction  Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent  and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing   Think of me to  morrow  my dear Emma  about four o  clock  was Mrs  Weston  s parting injunction  spoken with some anxiety  and meant only for her   Four o  clock  depend upon it he will be here by three  was Mr  Weston  s quick amendment  and so ended a most satisfactory meeting  Emma  s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness  every thing wore a different air  James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before  When she looked at the hedges  she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out  and when she turned round to Harriet  she saw something like a look of spring  a tender smile even there   Will Mr  Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford  was a question  however  which did not augur much  But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once  and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time  The morning of the interesting day arrived  and Mrs  Weston  s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten  or eleven  or twelve o  clock  that she was to think of her at four   My dear  dear anxious friend  said she  in mental soliloquy  while walking downstairs from her own room   always overcareful for every body  s comfort but your own  I see you now in all your little fidgets  going again and again into his room  to be sure that all is right  The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall   Tis twelve  I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence  and by this time to  morrow  perhaps  or a little later  I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here  I am sure they will bring him soon  She opened the parlour door  and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father  Mr  Weston and his son  They had been arrived only a few minutes  and Mr  Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank  s being a day before his time  and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations  when she appeared  to have her share of surprize  introduction  and pleasure  The Frank Churchill so long talked of  so high in interest  was actually before her  he was presented to her  and she did not think too much had been said in his praise  he was a _very_ good looking young man  height  air  address  all were unexceptionable  and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father  s  he looked quick and sensible  She felt immediately that she should like him  and there was a well  bred ease of manner  and a readiness to talk  which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her  and that acquainted they soon must be  He had reached Randalls the evening before  She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan  and travel earlier  later  and quicker  that he might gain half a day   I told you yesterday  cried Mr  Weston with exultation   I told you all that he would be here before the time named  I remembered what I used to do myself  One cannot creep upon a journey  one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned  and the pleasure of coming in upon one  s friends before the look  out begins  is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs   It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it  said the young man   though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far  but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing  The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency  Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable  the conviction was strengthened by what followed  He was very much pleased with Randalls  thought it a most admirably arranged house  would hardly allow it even to be very small  admired the situation  the walk to Highbury  Highbury itself  Hartfield still more  and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one  s _own_ country gives  and the greatest curiosity to visit it  That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before  passed suspiciously through Emma  s brain  but still  if it were a falsehood  it was a pleasant one  and pleasantly handled  His manner had no air of study or exaggeration  He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment  Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance  On his side were the inquiries  Was she a horsewoman  Pleasant rides  Pleasant walks  Had they a large neighbourhood  Highbury  perhaps  afforded society enough  There were several very pretty houses in and about it  Balls  had they balls  Was it a musical society  But when satisfied on all these points  and their acquaintance proportionably advanced  he contrived to find an opportunity  while their two fathers were engaged with each other  of introducing his mother  in  law  and speaking of her with so much handsome praise  so much warm admiration  so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father  and her very kind reception of himself  as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please  and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her  He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs  Weston  but  undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter  He understood what would be welcome  he could be sure of little else   His father  s marriage  he said   had been the wisest measure  every friend must rejoice in it  and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him  He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor  s merits  without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse  s character  than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor  s  And at last  as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object  he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person   Elegant  agreeable manners  I was prepared for  said he   but I confess that  considering every thing  I had not expected more than a very tolerably well  looking woman of a certain age  I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs  Weston   You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs  Weston for my feelings  said Emma   were you to guess her to be _eighteen_  I should listen with pleasure  but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words  Don  t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman   I hope I should know better  he replied   no  depend upon it   with a gallant bow  that in addressing Mrs  Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms  Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other  which had taken strong possession of her mind  had ever crossed his  and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence  or proofs of defiance  She must see more of him to understand his ways  at present she only felt they were agreeable  She had no doubt of what Mr  Weston was often thinking about  His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression  and even  when he might have determined not to look  she was confident that he was often listening  Her own father  s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind  the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion  was a most comfortable circumstance  Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it  Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged  he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any  it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons  understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them  She blessed the favouring blindness  He could now  without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise  without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest  give way to all his natural kind  hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr  Frank Churchill  s accommodation on his journey  through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road  and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold  which  however  he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night  A reasonable visit paid  Mr  Weston began to move  He must be going  He had business at the Crown about his hay  and a great many errands for Mrs  Weston at Ford  s  but he need not hurry any body else  His son  too well bred to hear the hint  rose immediately also  saying   As you are going farther on business  sir  I will take the opportunity of paying a visit  which must be paid some day or other  and therefore may as well be paid now  I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours   turning to Emma  a lady residing in or near Highbury  a family of the name of Fairfax  I shall have no difficulty  I suppose  in finding the house  though Fairfax  I believe  is not the proper name  I should rather say Barnes  or Bates  Do you know any family of that name   To be sure we do  cried his father   Mrs  Bates  we passed her house  I saw Miss Bates at the window  True  true  you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax  I remember you knew her at Weymouth  and a fine girl she is  Call upon her  by all means   There is no necessity for my calling this morning  said the young man   another day would do as well  but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which   Oh  go to  day  go to  day  Do not defer it  What is right to be done cannot be done too soon  And  besides  I must give you a hint  Frank  any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided  You saw her with the Campbells  when she was the equal of every body she mixed with  but here she is with a poor old grandmother  who has barely enough to live on  If you do not call early it will be a slight  The son looked convinced   I have heard her speak of the acquaintance  said Emma   she is a very elegant young woman  He agreed to it  but with so quiet a  Yes  as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence  and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world  if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it   If you were never particularly struck by her manners before  said she   I think you will to  day  You will see her to advantage  see her and hear her  no  I am afraid you will not hear her at all  for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue   You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax  sir  are you  said Mr  Woodhouse  always the last to make his way in conversation   then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady  She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt  very worthy people  I have known them all my life  They will be extremely glad to see you  I am sure  and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way   My dear sir  upon no account in the world  my father can direct me   But your father is not going so far  he is only going to the Crown  quite on the other side of the street  and there are a great many houses  you might be very much at a loss  and it is a very dirty walk  unless you keep on the footpath  but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street  Mr  Frank Churchill still declined it  looking as serious as he could  and his father gave his hearty support by calling out   My good friend  this is quite unnecessary  Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it  and as to Mrs  Bates  s  he may get there from the Crown in a hop  step  and jump  They were permitted to go alone  and with a cordial nod from one  and a graceful bow from the other  the two gentlemen took leave  Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance  and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day  with full confidence in their comfort  CHAPTER VI The next morning brought Mr  Frank Churchill again  He came with Mrs  Weston  to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially  He had been sitting with her  it appeared  most companionably at home  till her usual hour of exercise  and on being desired to chuse their walk  immediately fixed on Highbury  He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction  but if left to him  he should always chuse the same  Highbury  that airy  cheerful  happy  looking Highbury  would be his constant attraction  Highbury  with Mrs  Weston  stood for Hartfield  and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him  They walked thither directly  Emma had hardly expected them  for Mr  Weston  who had called in for half a minute  in order to hear that his son was very handsome  knew nothing of their plans  and it was an agreeable surprize to her  therefore  to perceive them walking up to the house together  arm in arm  She was wanting to see him again  and especially to see him in company with Mrs  Weston  upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend  If he were deficient there  nothing should make amends for it  But on seeing them together  she became perfectly satisfied  It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty  nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her  nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection  And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment  as their visit included all the rest of the morning  They were all three walking about together for an hour or two  first round the shrubberies of Hartfield  and afterwards in Highbury  He was delighted with every thing  admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr  Woodhouse  s ear  and when their going farther was resolved on  confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village  and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed  Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings  He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long  and which had been the home of his father  s father  and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living  walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other  and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit  they shewed  altogether  a good  will towards Highbury in general  which must be very like a merit to those he was with  Emma watched and decided  that with such feelings as were now shewn  it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself  that he had not been acting a part  or making a parade of insincere professions  and that Mr  Knightley certainly had not done him justice  Their first pause was at the Crown Inn  an inconsiderable house  though the principal one of the sort  where a couple of pair of post  horses were kept  more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road  and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there  but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added  it had been built many years ago for a ball  room  and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous  dancing state  had been occasionally used as such  but such brilliant days had long passed away  and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half  gentlemen of the place  He was immediately interested  Its character as a ball  room caught him  and instead of passing on  he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open  to look in and contemplate its capabilities  and lament that its original purpose should have ceased  He saw no fault in the room  he would acknowledge none which they suggested  No  it was long enough  broad enough  handsome enough  It would hold the very number for comfort  They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter  Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room  She who could do any thing in Highbury  The want of proper families in the place  and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend  were mentioned  but he was not satisfied  He could not be persuaded that so many good  looking houses as he saw around him  could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting  and even when particulars were given and families described  he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing  or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body  s returning into their proper place the next morning  He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing  and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills  He seemed to have all the life and spirit  cheerful feelings  and social inclinations of his father  and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe  Of pride  indeed  there was  perhaps  scarcely enough  his indifference to a confusion of rank  bordered too much on inelegance of mind  He could be no judge  however  of the evil he was holding cheap  It was but an effusion of lively spirits  At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown  and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged  Emma recollected his intended visit the day before  and asked him if he had paid it   Yes  oh  yes  he replied   I was just going to mention it  A very successful visit  I saw all the three ladies  and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint  If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize  it must have been the death of me  As it was  I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit  Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary  perhaps all that was proper  and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him  but there was no getting away  no pause  and  to my utter astonishment  I found  when he  finding me nowhere else  joined me there at last  that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three  quarters of an hour  The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before   And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking   Ill  very ill  that is  if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill  But the expression is hardly admissible  Mrs  Weston  is it  Ladies can never look ill  And  seriously  Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale  as almost always to give the appearance of ill health  A most deplorable want of complexion  Emma would not agree to this  and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax  s complexion   It was certainly never brilliant  but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general  and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face  He listened with all due deference  acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same  but yet he must confess  that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health  Where features were indifferent  a fine complexion gave beauty to them all  and where they were good  the effect was  fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was   Well  said Emma   there is no disputing about taste  At least you admire her except her complexion  He shook his head and laughed  I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion   Did you see her often at Weymouth  Were you often in the same society  At this moment they were approaching Ford  s  and he hastily exclaimed   Ha  this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives  as my father informs me  He comes to Highbury himself  he says  six days out of the seven  and has always business at Ford  s  If it be not inconvenient to you  pray let us go in  that I may prove myself to belong to the place  to be a true citizen of Highbury  I must buy something at Ford  s  It will be taking out my freedom  I dare say they sell gloves   Oh  yes  gloves and every thing  I do admire your patriotism  You will be adored in Highbury  You were very popular before you came  because you were Mr  Weston  s son  but lay out half a guinea at Ford  s  and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues  They went in  and while the sleek  well  tied parcels of  Men  s Beavers  and  York Tan  were bringing down and displaying on the counter  he said  But I beg your pardon  Miss Woodhouse  you were speaking to me  you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_  Do not let me lose it  I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life   I merely asked  whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth   And now that I understand your question  I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one  It is always the lady  s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance  Miss Fairfax must already have given her account  I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow   Upon my word  you answer as discreetly as she could do herself  But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed  she is so very reserved  so very unwilling to give the least information about any body  that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her   May I  indeed  Then I will speak the truth  and nothing suits me so well  I met her frequently at Weymouth  I had known the Campbells a little in town  and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set  Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man  and Mrs  Campbell a friendly  warm  hearted woman  I like them all   You know Miss Fairfax  s situation in life  I conclude  what she is destined to be   Yes  rather hesitatingly  I believe I do   You get upon delicate subjects  Emma  said Mrs  Weston smiling   remember that I am here  Mr  Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax  s situation in life  I will move a little farther off   I certainly do forget to think of _her_  said Emma   as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend  He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment  When the gloves were bought  and they had quitted the shop again   Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of  play  said Frank Churchill   Ever hear her  repeated Emma   You forget how much she belongs to Highbury  I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began  She plays charmingly   You think so  do you  I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge  She appeared to me to play well  that is  with considerable taste  but I know nothing of the matter myself  I am excessively fond of music  but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body  s performance  I have been used to hear her  s admired  and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well  a man  a very musical man  and in love with another woman  engaged to her  on the point of marriage  would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument  if the lady in question could sit down instead  never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other  That  I thought  in a man of known musical talent  was some proof   Proof indeed  said Emma  highly amused  Mr  Dixon is very musical  is he  We shall know more about them all  in half an hour  from you  than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year   Yes  Mr  Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons  and I thought it a very strong proof   Certainly  very strong it was  to own the truth  a great deal stronger than  if _I_ had been Miss Campbell  would have been at all agreeable to me  I could not excuse a man  s having more music than love  more ear than eye  a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings  How did Miss Campbell appear to like it   It was her very particular friend  you know   Poor comfort  said Emma  laughing   One would rather have a stranger preferred than one  s very particular friend  with a stranger it might not recur again  but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand  to do every thing better than one does oneself  Poor Mrs  Dixon  Well  I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland   You are right  It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell  but she really did not seem to feel it   So much the better  or so much the worse  I do not know which  But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her  quickness of friendship  or dulness of feeling  there was one person  I think  who must have felt it  Miss Fairfax herself  She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction   As to that  I do not   Oh  do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax  s sensations from you  or from any body else  They are known to no human being  I guess  but herself  But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr  Dixon  one may guess what one chuses   There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all  he began rather quickly  but checking himself  added   however  it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were  how it might all be behind the scenes  I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly  But you  who have known Miss Fairfax from a child  must be a better judge of her character  and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations  than I can be   I have known her from a child  undoubtedly  we have been children and women together  and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate  that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends  But we never did  I hardly know how it has happened  a little  perhaps  from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was  by her aunt and grandmother  and all their set  And then  her reserve  I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved   It is a most repulsive quality  indeed  said he   Oftentimes very convenient  no doubt  but never pleasing  There is safety in reserve  but no attraction  One cannot love a reserved person   Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself  and then the attraction may be the greater  But I must be more in want of a friend  or an agreeable companion  than I have yet been  to take the trouble of conquering any body  s reserve to procure one  Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question  I have no reason to think ill of her  not the least  except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner  such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body  is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal  He perfectly agreed with her  and after walking together so long  and thinking so much alike  Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him  that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting  He was not exactly what she had expected  less of the man of the world in some of his notions  less of the spoiled child of fortune  therefore better than she had expected  His ideas seemed more moderate  his feelings warmer  She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr  Elton  s house  which  as well as the church  he would go and look at  and would not join them in finding much fault with  No  he could not believe it a bad house  not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having  If it were to be shared with the woman he loved  he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house  There must be ample room in it for every real comfort  The man must be a blockhead who wanted more  Mrs  Weston laughed  and said he did not know what he was talking about  Used only to a large house himself  and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size  he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one  But Emma  in her own mind  determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about  and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life  and to marry  from worthy motives  He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper  s room  or a bad butler  s pantry  but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy  and that whenever he were attached  he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment  CHAPTER VII Emma  s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day  by hearing that he was gone off to London  merely to have his hair cut  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast  and he had sent for a chaise and set off  intending to return to dinner  but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut  There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand  but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve  It did not accord with the rationality of plan  the moderation in expense  or even the unselfish warmth of heart  which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday  Vanity  extravagance  love of change  restlessness of temper  which must be doing something  good or bad  heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs  Weston  indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general  he became liable to all these charges  His father only called him a coxcomb  and thought it a very good story  but that Mrs  Weston did not like it  was clear enough  by her passing it over as quickly as possible  and making no other comment than that  all young people would have their little whims  With the exception of this little blot  Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him  Mrs  Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself  how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether  He appeared to have a very open temper  certainly a very cheerful and lively one  she could observe nothing wrong in his notions  a great deal decidedly right  he spoke of his uncle with warm regard  was fond of talking of him  said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself  and though there was no being attached to the aunt  he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude  and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect  This was all very promising  and  but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut  there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him  the honour  if not of being really in love with her  of being at least very near it  and saved only by her own indifference   for still her resolution held of never marrying  the honour  in short  of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance  Mr  Weston  on his side  added a virtue to the account which must have some weight  He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely  thought her very beautiful and very charming  and with so much to be said for him altogether  she found she must not judge him harshly  As Mrs  Weston observed   all young people would have their little whims  There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry  not so leniently disposed  In general he was judged  throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury  with great candour  liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man  one who smiled so often and bowed so well  but there was one spirit among them not to be softened  from its power of censure  by bows or smiles  Mr  Knightley  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield  for the moment  he was silent  but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself  over a newspaper he held in his hand   Hum  just the trifling  silly fellow I took him for  She had half a mind to resent  but an instant  s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings  and not meant to provoke  and therefore she let it pass  Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings  Mr  and Mrs  Weston  s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune  Something occurred while they were at Hartfield  to make Emma want their advice  and  which was still more lucky  she wanted exactly the advice they gave  This was the occurrence  The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury  and were very good sort of people  friendly  liberal  and unpretending  but  on the other hand  they were of low origin  in trade  and only moderately genteel  On their first coming into the country  they had lived in proportion to their income  quietly  keeping little company  and that little unexpensively  but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means  the house in town had yielded greater profits  and fortune in general had smiled on them  With their wealth  their views increased  their want of a larger house  their inclination for more company  They added to their house  to their number of servants  to their expenses of every sort  and by this time were  in fortune and style of living  second only to the family at Hartfield  Their love of society  and their new dining  room  prepared every body for their keeping dinner  company  and a few parties  chiefly among the single men  had already taken place  The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite  neither Donwell  nor Hartfield  nor Randalls  Nothing should tempt _her_ to go  if they did  and she regretted that her father  s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish  The Coles were very respectable in their way  but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them  This lesson  she very much feared  they would receive only from herself  she had little hope of Mr  Knightley  none of Mr  Weston  But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared  that when the insult came at last  it found her very differently affected  Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation  and none had come for her father and herself  and Mrs  Weston  s accounting for it with  I suppose they will not take the liberty with you  they know you do not dine out  was not quite sufficient  She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal  and afterwards  as the idea of the party to be assembled there  consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her  occurred again and again  she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept  Harriet was to be there in the evening  and the Bateses  They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before  and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence  Might not the evening end in a dance  had been a question of his  The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits  and her being left in solitary grandeur  even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment  was but poor comfort  It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield  which made their presence so acceptable  for though her first remark  on reading it  was that  of course it must be declined  she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do  that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful  She owned that  considering every thing  she was not absolutely without inclination for the party  The Coles expressed themselves so properly  there was so much real attention in the manner of it  so much consideration for her father   They would have solicited the honour earlier  but had been waiting the arrival of a folding  screen from London  which they hoped might keep Mr  Woodhouse from any draught of air  and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company  Upon the whole  she was very persuadable  and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort  how certainly Mrs  Goddard  if not Mrs  Bates  might be depended on for bearing him company  Mr  Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter  s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand  and spending the whole evening away from him  As for _his_ going  Emma did not wish him to think it possible  the hours would be too late  and the party too numerous  He was soon pretty well resigned   I am not fond of dinner  visiting  said he  I never was  No more is Emma  Late hours do not agree with us  I am sorry Mr  and Mrs  Cole should have done it  I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer  and take their tea with us  take us in their afternoon walk  which they might do  as our hours are so reasonable  and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening  The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to  However  as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them  and as you will both be there  and Mr  Knightley too  to take care of her  I cannot wish to prevent it  provided the weather be what it ought  neither damp  nor cold  nor windy  Then turning to Mrs  Weston  with a look of gentle reproach  Ah  Miss Taylor  if you had not married  you would have staid at home with me   Well  sir  cried Mr  Weston   as I took Miss Taylor away  it is incumbent on me to supply her place  if I can  and I will step to Mrs  Goddard in a moment  if you wish it  But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_  was increasing  not lessening  Mr  Woodhouse  s agitation  The ladies knew better how to allay it  Mr  Weston must be quiet  and every thing deliberately arranged  With this treatment  Mr  Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual   He should be happy to see Mrs  Goddard  He had a great regard for Mrs  Goddard  and Emma should write a line  and invite her  James could take the note  But first of all  there must be an answer written to Mrs  Cole   You will make my excuses  my dear  as civilly as possible  You will say that I am quite an invalid  and go no where  and therefore must decline their obliging invitation  beginning with my _compliments_  of course  But you will do every thing right  I need not tell you what is to be done  We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday  I shall have no fears for you with him  We have never been there above once since the new approach was made  but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely  And when you get there  you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again  and you had better name an early hour  You will not like staying late  You will get very tired when tea is over   But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired  papa   Oh  no  my love  but you will soon be tired  There will be a great many people talking at once  You will not like the noise   But  my dear sir  cried Mr  Weston   if Emma comes away early  it will be breaking up the party   And no great harm if it does  said Mr  Woodhouse   The sooner every party breaks up  the better   But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles  Emma  s going away directly after tea might be giving offence  They are good  natured people  and think little of their own claims  but still they must feel that any body  s hurrying away is no great compliment  and Miss Woodhouse  s doing it would be more thought of than any other person  s in the room  You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles  I am sure  sir  friendly  good sort of people as ever lived  and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years   No  upon no account in the world  Mr  Weston  I am much obliged to you for reminding me  I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain  I know what worthy people they are  Perry tells me that Mr  Cole never touches malt liquor  You would not think it to look at him  but he is bilious  Mr  Cole is very bilious  No  I would not be the means of giving them any pain  My dear Emma  we must consider this  I am sure  rather than run the risk of hurting Mr  and Mrs  Cole  you would stay a little longer than you might wish  You will not regard being tired  You will be perfectly safe  you know  among your friends   Oh yes  papa  I have no fears at all for myself  and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs  Weston  but on your account  I am only afraid of your sitting up for me  I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs  Goddard  She loves piquet  you know  but when she is gone home  I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself  instead of going to bed at your usual time  and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort  You must promise me not to sit up  He did  on the condition of some promises on her side  such as that  if she came home cold  she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly  if hungry  that she would take something to eat  that her own maid should sit up for her  and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house  as usual  CHAPTER VIII Frank Churchill came back again  and if he kept his father  s dinner waiting  it was not known at Hartfield  for Mrs  Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr  Woodhouse  to betray any imperfection which could be concealed  He came back  had had his hair cut  and laughed at himself with a very good grace  but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done  He had no reason to wish his hair longer  to conceal any confusion of face  no reason to wish the money unspent  to improve his spirits  He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever  and  after seeing him  Emma thus moralised to herself   I do not know whether it ought to be so  but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way  Wickedness is always wickedness  but folly is not always folly  It depends upon the character of those who handle it  Mr  Knightley  he is _not_ a trifling  silly young man  If he were  he would have done this differently  He would either have gloried in the achievement  or been ashamed of it  There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb  or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities  No  I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly  With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again  and for a longer time than hitherto  of judging of his general manners  and by inference  of the meaning of his manners towards herself  of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air  and of fancying what the observations of all those might be  who were now seeing them together for the first time  She meant to be very happy  in spite of the scene being laid at Mr  Cole  s  and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr  Elton  even in the days of his favour  none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr  Cole  Her father  s comfort was amply secured  Mrs  Bates as well as Mrs  Goddard being able to come  and her last pleasing duty  before she left the house  was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner  and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress  to make the two ladies all the amends in her power  by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine  for whatever unwilling self  denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal  She had provided a plentiful dinner for them  she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it  She followed another carriage to Mr  Cole  s door  and was pleased to see that it was Mr  Knightley  s  for Mr  Knightley keeping no horses  having little spare money and a great deal of health  activity  and independence  was too apt  in Emma  s opinion  to get about as he could  and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey  She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart  for he stopped to hand her out   This is coming as you should do  said she   like a gentleman  I am quite glad to see you  He thanked her  observing   How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment  for  if we had met first in the drawing  room  I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual  You might not have distinguished how I came  by my look or manner   Yes I should  I am sure I should  There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them  You think you carry it off very well  I dare say  but with you it is a sort of bravado  an air of affected unconcern  I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances  _Now_ you have nothing to try for  You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed  You are not striving to look taller than any body else  _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you   Nonsensical girl  was his reply  but not at all in anger  Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr  Knightley  She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please  and given all the consequence she could wish for  When the Westons arrived  the kindest looks of love  the strongest of admiration were for her  from both husband and wife  the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object  and at dinner she found him seated by her  and  as she firmly believed  not without some dexterity on his side  The party was rather large  as it included one other family  a proper unobjectionable country family  whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance  and the male part of Mr  Cox  s family  the lawyer of Highbury  The less worthy females were to come in the evening  with Miss Bates  Miss Fairfax  and Miss Smith  but already  at dinner  they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general  and  while politics and Mr  Elton were talked over  Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour  The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend  was the name of Jane Fairfax  Mrs  Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting  She listened  and found it well worth listening to  That very dear part of Emma  her fancy  received an amusing supply  Mrs  Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates  and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte  a very elegant looking instrument  not a grand  but a large  sized square pianoforte  and the substance of the story  the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize  and inquiry  and congratulations on her side  and explanations on Miss Bates  s  was  that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood  s the day before  to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece  entirely unexpected  that at first  by Miss Bates  s account  Jane herself was quite at a loss  quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it  but now  they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter  of course it must be from Colonel Campbell   One can suppose nothing else  added Mrs  Cole   and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt  But Jane  it seems  had a letter from them very lately  and not a word was said about it  She knows their ways best  but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present  They might chuse to surprize her  Mrs  Cole had many to agree with her  every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell  and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made  and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way  and still listen to Mrs  Cole   I declare  I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction  It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax  who plays so delightfully  should not have an instrument  It seemed quite a shame  especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away  This is like giving ourselves a slap  to be sure  and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr  Cole  I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing  room  while I do not know one note from another  and our little girls  who are but just beginning  perhaps may never make any thing of it  and there is poor Jane Fairfax  who is mistress of music  has not any thing of the nature of an instrument  not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world  to amuse herself with  I was saying this to Mr  Cole but yesterday  and he quite agreed with me  only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase  hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can  and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought  or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it  We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening  Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence  and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs  Cole  s  turned to Frank Churchill   Why do you smile  said she   Nay  why do you   Me  I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell  s being so rich and so liberal  It is a handsome present   Very   I rather wonder that it was never made before   Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before   Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument  which must now be shut up in London  untouched by any body   That is a grand pianoforte  and he might think it too large for Mrs  Bates  s house   You may _say_ what you chuse  but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine   I do not know  I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve  I smile because you smile  and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect  but at present I do not see what there is to question  If Colonel Campbell is not the person  who can be   What do you say to Mrs  Dixon   Mrs  Dixon  very true indeed  I had not thought of Mrs  Dixon  She must know as well as her father  how acceptable an instrument would be  and perhaps the mode of it  the mystery  the surprize  is more like a young woman  s scheme than an elderly man  s  It is Mrs  Dixon  I dare say  I told you that your suspicions would guide mine   If so  you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_  Dixon in them   Mr  Dixon  Very well  Yes  I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr  and Mrs  Dixon  We were speaking the other day  you know  of his being so warm an admirer of her performance   Yes  and what you told me on that head  confirmed an idea which I had entertained before  I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr  Dixon or Miss Fairfax  but I cannot help suspecting either that  after making his proposals to her friend  he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_  or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side  One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right  but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland  Here  she must be leading a life of privation and penance  there it would have been all enjoyment  As to the pretence of trying her native air  I look upon that as a mere excuse  In the summer it might have passed  but what can any body  s native air do for them in the months of January  February  and March  Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health  and I dare say in her  s  I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions  though you make so noble a profession of doing it  but I honestly tell you what they are   And  upon my word  they have an air of great probability  Mr  Dixon  s preference of her music to her friend  s  I can answer for being very decided   And then  he saved her life  Did you ever hear of that  A water party  and by some accident she was falling overboard  He caught her   He did  I was there  one of the party   Were you really  Well  But you observed nothing of course  for it seems to be a new idea to you  If I had been there  I think I should have made some discoveries   I dare say you would  but I  simple I  saw nothing but the fact  that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr  Dixon caught her  It was the work of a moment  And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable  indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again  yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable  I do not mean to say  however  that you might not have made discoveries  The conversation was here interrupted  They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses  and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others  but when the table was again safely covered  when every corner dish was placed exactly right  and occupation and ease were generally restored  Emma said   The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me  I wanted to know a little more  and this tells me quite enough  Depend upon it  we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr  and Mrs  Dixon   And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells   No  I am sure it is not from the Campbells  Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells  or they would have been guessed at first  She would not have been puzzled  had she dared fix on them  I may not have convinced you perhaps  but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr  Dixon is a principal in the business   Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced  Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely  At first  while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver  I saw it only as paternal kindness  and thought it the most natural thing in the world  But when you mentioned Mrs  Dixon  I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship  And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love  There was no occasion to press the matter farther  The conviction seemed real  he looked as if he felt it  She said no more  other subjects took their turn  and the rest of the dinner passed away  the dessert succeeded  the children came in  and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation  a few clever things said  a few downright silly  but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other  nothing worse than everyday remarks  dull repetitions  old news  and heavy jokes  The ladies had not been long in the drawing  room  before the other ladies  in their different divisions  arrived  Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend  and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace  she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner  but could most heartily rejoice in that light  cheerful  unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure  in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection  There she sat  and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding  To be in company  nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed  to sit and smile and look pretty  and say nothing  was enough for the happiness of the present hour  Jane Fairfax did look and move superior  but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet  very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved  yes  of having loved even Mr  Elton in vain  by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend  In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her  She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte  she felt too much in the secret herself  to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair  and therefore purposely kept at a distance  but by the others  the subject was almost immediately introduced  and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received  the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of  my excellent friend Colonel Campbell  Mrs  Weston  kind  hearted and musical  was particularly interested by the circumstance  and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject  and having so much to ask and to say as to tone  touch  and pedal  totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible  which she plainly read in the fair heroine  s countenance  They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen  and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill  In he walked  the first and the handsomest  and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece  made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle  where sat Miss Woodhouse  and till he could find a seat by her  would not sit at all  Emma divined what every body present must be thinking  She was his object  and every body must perceive it  She introduced him to her friend  Miss Smith  and  at convenient moments afterwards  heard what each thought of the other   He had never seen so lovely a face  and was delighted with her naivete  And she   Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment  but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr  Elton  Emma restrained her indignation  and only turned from her in silence  Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax  but it was most prudent to avoid speech  He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining  room  hated sitting long  was always the first to move when he could  that his father  Mr  Knightley  Mr  Cox  and Mr  Cole  were left very busy over parish business  that as long as he had staid  however  it had been pleasant enough  as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike  sensible men  and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether  thought it so abundant in agreeable families  that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much  She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire  the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe  and the sort  and could make out from his answers that  as far as Enscombe was concerned  there was very little going on  that their visitings were among a range of great families  none very near  and that even when days were fixed  and invitations accepted  it was an even chance that Mrs  Churchill were not in health and spirits for going  that they made a point of visiting no fresh person  and that  though he had his separate engagements  it was not without difficulty  without considerable address _at_ _times_  that he could get away  or introduce an acquaintance for a night  She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy  and that Highbury  taken at its best  might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked  His importance at Enscombe was very evident  He did not boast  but it naturally betrayed itself  that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing  and on her laughing and noticing it  he owned that he believed  excepting one or two points  he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing  One of those points on which his influence failed  he then mentioned  He had wanted very much to go abroad  had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel  but she would not hear of it  This had happened the year before  _Now_  he said  he was beginning to have no longer the same wish  The unpersuadable point  which he did not mention  Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father   I have made a most wretched discovery  said he  after a short pause   I have been here a week to  morrow  half my time  I never knew days fly so fast  A week to  morrow  And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself  But just got acquainted with Mrs  Weston  and others  I hate the recollection   Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day  out of so few  in having your hair cut   No  said he  smiling   that is no subject of regret at all  I have no pleasure in seeing my friends  unless I can believe myself fit to be seen  The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room  Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes  and listen to Mr  Cole  When Mr  Cole had moved away  and her attention could be restored as before  she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax  who was sitting exactly opposite   What is the matter  said she  He started   Thank you for rousing me  he replied   I believe I have been very rude  but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way  so very odd a way  that I cannot keep my eyes from her  I never saw any thing so outree  Those curls  This must be a fancy of her own  I see nobody else looking like her  I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion  Shall I  Yes  I will  I declare I will  and you shall see how she takes it  whether she colours  He was gone immediately  and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax  and talking to her  but as to its effect on the young lady  as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them  exactly in front of Miss Fairfax  she could absolutely distinguish nothing  Before he could return to his chair  it was taken by Mrs  Weston   This is the luxury of a large party  said she  one can get near every body  and say every thing  My dear Emma  I am longing to talk to you  I have been making discoveries and forming plans  just like yourself  and I must tell them while the idea is fresh  Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here   How  They were invited  were not they   Oh  yes  but how they were conveyed hither  the manner of their coming   They walked  I conclude  How else could they come   Very true  Well  a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again  late at night  and cold as the nights are now  And as I looked at her  though I never saw her appear to more advantage  it struck me that she was heated  and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold  Poor girl  I could not bear the idea of it  so  as soon as Mr  Weston came into the room  and I could get at him  I spoke to him about the carriage  You may guess how readily he came into my wishes  and having his approbation  I made my way directly to Miss Bates  to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home  for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once  Good soul  she was as grateful as possible  you may be sure  ` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself  but with many  many thanks ` there was no occasion to trouble us  for Mr  Knightley  s carriage had brought  and was to take them home again  I was quite surprized  very glad  I am sure  but really quite surprized  Such a very kind attention  and so thoughtful an attention  the sort of thing that so few men would think of  And  in short  from knowing his usual ways  I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all  I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself  and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them   Very likely  said Emma  nothing more likely  I know no man more likely than Mr  Knightley to do the sort of thing  to do any thing really good  natured  useful  considerate  or benevolent  He is not a gallant man  but he is a very humane one  and this  considering Jane Fairfax  s ill  health  would appear a case of humanity to him  and for an act of unostentatious kindness  there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr  Knightley  I know he had horses to  day  for we arrived together  and I laughed at him about it  but he said not a word that could betray   Well  said Mrs  Weston  smiling   you give him credit for more simple  disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do  for while Miss Bates was speaking  a suspicion darted into my head  and I have never been able to get it out again  The more I think of it  the more probable it appears  In short  I have made a match between Mr  Knightley and Jane Fairfax  See the consequence of keeping you company  What do you say to it   Mr  Knightley and Jane Fairfax  exclaimed Emma   Dear Mrs  Weston  how could you think of such a thing  Mr  Knightley  Mr  Knightley must not marry  You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell  Oh  no  no  Henry must have Donwell  I cannot at all consent to Mr  Knightley  s marrying  and I am sure it is not at all likely  I am amazed that you should think of such a thing   My dear Emma  I have told you what led me to think of it  I do not want the match  I do not want to injure dear little Henry  but the idea has been given me by circumstances  and if Mr  Knightley really wished to marry  you would not have him refrain on Henry  s account  a boy of six years old  who knows nothing of the matter   Yes  I would  I could not bear to have Henry supplanted  Mr  Knightley marry  No  I have never had such an idea  and I cannot adopt it now  And Jane Fairfax  too  of all women   Nay  she has always been a first favourite with him  as you very well know   But the imprudence of such a match   I am not speaking of its prudence  merely its probability   I see no probability in it  unless you have any better foundation than what you mention  His good  nature  his humanity  as I tell you  would be quite enough to account for the horses  He has a great regard for the Bateses  you know  independent of Jane Fairfax  and is always glad to shew them attention  My dear Mrs  Weston  do not take to match  making  You do it very ill  Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey  Oh  no  no  every feeling revolts  For his own sake  I would not have him do so mad a thing   Imprudent  if you please  but not mad  Excepting inequality of fortune  and perhaps a little disparity of age  I can see nothing unsuitable   But Mr  Knightley does not want to marry  I am sure he has not the least idea of it  Do not put it into his head  Why should he marry  He is as happy as possible by himself  with his farm  and his sheep  and his library  and all the parish to manage  and he is extremely fond of his brother  s children  He has no occasion to marry  either to fill up his time or his heart   My dear Emma  as long as he thinks so  it is so  but if he really loves Jane Fairfax   Nonsense  He does not care about Jane Fairfax  In the way of love  I am sure he does not  He would do any good to her  or her family  but   Well  said Mrs  Weston  laughing   perhaps the greatest good he could do them  would be to give Jane such a respectable home   If it would be good to her  I am sure it would be evil to himself  a very shameful and degrading connexion  How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him  To have her haunting the Abbey  and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane  ` So very kind and obliging  But he always had been such a very kind neighbour  And then fly off  through half a sentence  to her mother  s old petticoat  ` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either  for still it would last a great while  and  indeed  she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong   For shame  Emma  Do not mimic her  You divert me against my conscience  And  upon my word  I do not think Mr  Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates  Little things do not irritate him  She might talk on  and if he wanted to say any thing himself  he would only talk louder  and drown her voice  But the question is not  whether it would be a bad connexion for him  but whether he wishes it  and I think he does  I have heard him speak  and so must you  so very highly of Jane Fairfax  The interest he takes in her  his anxiety about her health  his concern that she should have no happier prospect  I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points  Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte  and of her voice  I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever  Oh  and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me  this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody  though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells  may it not be from Mr  Knightley  I cannot help suspecting him  I think he is just the person to do it  even without being in love   Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love  But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do  Mr  Knightley does nothing mysteriously   I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly  oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would  in the common course of things  occur to him   Very well  and if he had intended to give her one  he would have told her so   There might be scruples of delicacy  my dear Emma  I have a very strong notion that it comes from him  I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs  Cole told us of it at dinner   You take up an idea  Mrs  Weston  and run away with it  as you have many a time reproached me with doing  I see no sign of attachment  I believe nothing of the pianoforte  and proof only shall convince me that Mr  Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax  They combated the point some time longer in the same way  Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend  for Mrs  Weston was the most used of the two to yield  till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over  and the instrument in preparation  and at the same moment Mr  Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it  Frank Churchill  of whom  in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs  Weston  she had been seeing nothing  except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax  followed Mr  Cole  to add his very pressing entreaties  and as  in every respect  it suited Emma best to lead  she gave a very proper compliance  She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit  she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable  and could accompany her own voice well  One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize  a second  slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill  Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song  and every thing usual followed  He was accused of having a delightful voice  and a perfect knowledge of music  which was properly denied  and that he knew nothing of the matter  and had no voice at all  roundly asserted  They sang together once more  and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax  whose performance  both vocal and instrumental  she never could attempt to conceal from herself  was infinitely superior to her own  With mixed feelings  she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument  to listen  Frank Churchill sang again  They had sung together once or twice  it appeared  at Weymouth  But the sight of Mr  Knightley among the most attentive  soon drew away half Emma  s mind  and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs  Weston  s suspicions  to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions  Her objections to Mr  Knightley  s marrying did not in the least subside  She could see nothing but evil in it  It would be a great disappointment to Mr  John Knightley  consequently to Isabella  A real injury to the children  a most mortifying change  and material loss to them all  a very great deduction from her father  s daily comfort  and  as to herself  she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey  A Mrs  Knightley for them all to give way to  No  Mr  Knightley must never marry  Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell  Presently Mr  Knightley looked back  and came and sat down by her  They talked at first only of the performance  His admiration was certainly very warm  yet she thought  but for Mrs  Weston  it would not have struck her  As a sort of touchstone  however  she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece  and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short  she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own   I often feel concern  said she   that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions  It is not that I am without the wish  but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put  to for such a purpose   Quite out of the question  quite out of the question  he replied   but you must often wish it  I am sure  And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction  that she must proceed another step   This present from the Campbells  said she  this pianoforte is very kindly given   Yes  he replied  and without the smallest apparent embarrassment   But they would have done better had they given her notice of it  Surprizes are foolish things  The pleasure is not enhanced  and the inconvenience is often considerable  I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell  From that moment  Emma could have taken her oath that Mr  Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument  But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment  whether there were no actual preference  remained a little longer doubtful  Towards the end of Jane  s second song  her voice grew thick   That will do  said he  when it was finished  thinking aloud   you have sung quite enough for one evening  now be quiet  Another song  however  was soon begged for   One more  they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account  and would only ask for one more  And Frank Churchill was heard to say   I think you could manage this without effort  the first part is so very trifling  The strength of the song falls on the second  Mr  Knightley grew angry   That fellow  said he  indignantly   thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice  This must not be  And touching Miss Bates  who at that moment passed near  Miss Bates  are you mad  to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner  Go  and interfere  They have no mercy on her  Miss Bates  in her real anxiety for Jane  could hardly stay even to be grateful  before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing  Here ceased the concert part of the evening  for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers  but soon  within five minutes  the proposal of dancing  originating nobody exactly knew where  was so effectually promoted by Mr  and Mrs  Cole  that every thing was rapidly clearing away  to give proper space  Mrs  Weston  capital in her country  dances  was seated  and beginning an irresistible waltz  and Frank Churchill  coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma  had secured her hand  and led her up to the top  While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off  Emma found time  in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste  to look about  and see what became of Mr  Knightley  This would be a trial  He was no dancer in general  If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now  it might augur something  There was no immediate appearance  No  he was talking to Mrs  Cole  he was looking on unconcerned  Jane was asked by somebody else  and he was still talking to Mrs  Cole  Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry  his interest was yet safe  and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment  Not more than five couple could be mustered  but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful  and she found herself well matched in a partner  They were a couple worth looking at  Two dances  unfortunately  were all that could be allowed  It was growing late  and Miss Bates became anxious to get home  on her mother  s account  After some attempts  therefore  to be permitted to begin again  they were obliged to thank Mrs  Weston  look sorrowful  and have done   Perhaps it is as well  said Frank Churchill  as he attended Emma to her carriage   I must have asked Miss Fairfax  and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me  after your  s  CHAPTER IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles  The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day  and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion  must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity  She must have delighted the Coles  worthy people  who deserved to be made happy  And left a name behind her that would not soon die away  Perfect happiness  even in memory  is not common  and there were two points on which she was not quite easy  She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman  in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax  s feelings to Frank Churchill  It was hardly right  but it had been so strong an idea  that it would escape her  and his submission to all that she told  was a compliment to her penetration  which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue  The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax  and there she had no doubt  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing  She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood  and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half  She was then interrupted by Harriet  s coming in  and if Harriet  s praise could have satisfied her  she might soon have been comforted   Oh  if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax   Don  t class us together  Harriet  My playing is no more like her  s  than a lamp is like sunshine   Oh  dear  I think you play the best of the two  I think you play quite as well as she does  I am sure I had much rather hear you  Every body last night said how well you played   Those who knew any thing about it  must have felt the difference  The truth is  Harriet  that my playing is just good enough to be praised  but Jane Fairfax  s is much beyond it   Well  I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does  or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out  Mr  Cole said how much taste you had  and Mr  Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste  and that he valued taste much more than execution   Ah  but Jane Fairfax has them both  Harriet   Are you sure  I saw she had execution  but I did not know she had any taste  Nobody talked about it  And I hate Italian singing  There is no understanding a word of it  Besides  if she does play so very well  you know  it is no more than she is obliged to do  because she will have to teach  The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family  How did you think the Coxes looked   Just as they always do  very vulgar   They told me something  said Harriet rather hesitatingly  but it is nothing of any consequence  Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her  though fearful of its producing Mr  Elton   They told me  that Mr  Martin dined with them last Saturday   Oh   He came to their father upon some business  and he asked him to stay to dinner   Oh   They talked a great deal about him  especially Anne Cox  I do not know what she meant  but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer   She meant to be impertinently curious  just as such an Anne Cox should be   She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there  He sat by her at dinner  Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him   Very likely  I think they are  without exception  the most vulgar girls in Highbury  Harriet had business at Ford  s  Emma thought it most prudent to go with her  Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible  and in her present state  would be dangerous  Harriet  tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word  was always very long at a purchase  and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind  Emma went to the door for amusement  Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury  Mr  Perry walking hastily by  Mr  William Cox letting himself in at the office  door  Mr  Cole  s carriage  horses returning from exercise  or a stray letter  boy on an obstinate mule  were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect  and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray  a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket  two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone  and a string of dawdling children round the baker  s little bow  window eyeing the gingerbread  she knew she had no reason to complain  and was amused enough  quite enough still to stand at the door  A mind lively and at ease  can do with seeing nothing  and can see nothing that does not answer  She looked down the Randalls road  The scene enlarged  two persons appeared  Mrs  Weston and her son  in  law  they were walking into Highbury  to Hartfield of course  They were stopping  however  in the first place at Mrs  Bates  s  whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford  s  and had all but knocked  when Emma caught their eye  Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her  and the agreeableness of yesterday  s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting  Mrs  Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses  in order to hear the new instrument   For my companion tells me  said she   that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night  that I would come this morning  I was not aware of it myself  I did not know that I had fixed a day  but as he says I did  I am going now   And while Mrs  Weston pays her visit  I may be allowed  I hope  said Frank Churchill   to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield  if you are going home  Mrs  Weston was disappointed   I thought you meant to go with me  They would be very much pleased   Me  I should be quite in the way  But  perhaps  I may be equally in the way here  Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me  My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping  She says I fidget her to death  and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same  What am I to do   I am here on no business of my own  said Emma   I am only waiting for my friend  She will probably have soon done  and then we shall go home  But you had better go with Mrs  Weston and hear the instrument   Well  if you advise it  But  with a smile  if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend  and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone  what shall I say  I shall be no support to Mrs  Weston  She might do very well by herself  A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips  but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood   I do not believe any such thing  replied Emma  I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours  when it is necessary  but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent  Quite otherwise indeed  if I understood Miss Fairfax  s opinion last night   Do come with me  said Mrs  Weston   if it be not very disagreeable to you  It need not detain us long  We will go to Hartfield afterwards  We will follow them to Hartfield  I really wish you to call with me  It will be felt so great an attention  and I always thought you meant it  He could say no more  and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him  returned with Mrs  Weston to Mrs  Bates  s door  Emma watched them in  and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter  trying  with all the force of her own mind  to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured  and that a blue ribbon  be it ever so beautiful  would still never match her yellow pattern  At last it was all settled  even to the destination of the parcel   Should I send it to Mrs  Goddard  s  ma  am  asked Mrs  Ford   Yes  no  yes  to Mrs  Goddard  s  Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield  No  you shall send it to Hartfield  if you please  But then  Mrs  Goddard will want to see it  And I could take the pattern gown home any day  But I shall want the ribbon directly  so it had better go to Hartfield  at least the ribbon  You could make it into two parcels  Mrs  Ford  could not you   It is not worth while  Harriet  to give Mrs  Ford the trouble of two parcels   No more it is   No trouble in the world  ma  am  said the obliging Mrs  Ford   Oh  but indeed I would much rather have it only in one  Then  if you please  you shall send it all to Mrs  Goddard  s  I do not know  No  I think  Miss Woodhouse  I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield  and take it home with me at night  What do you advise   That you do not give another half  second to the subject  To Hartfield  if you please  Mrs  Ford   Aye  that will be much best  said Harriet  quite satisfied   I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs  Goddard  s  Voices approached the shop  or rather one voice and two ladies  Mrs  Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door   My dear Miss Woodhouse  said the latter   I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while  and give us your opinion of our new instrument  you and Miss Smith  How do you do  Miss Smith  Very well I thank you  And I begged Mrs  Weston to come with me  that I might be sure of succeeding   I hope Mrs  Bates and Miss Fairfax are   Very well  I am much obliged to you  My mother is delightfully well  and Jane caught no cold last night  How is Mr  Woodhouse  I am so glad to hear such a good account  Mrs  Weston told me you were here  Oh  then  said I  I must run across  I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in  my mother will be so very happy to see her  and now we are such a nice party  she cannot refuse ` Aye  pray do  said Mr  Frank Churchill  ` Miss Woodhouse  s opinion of the instrument will be worth having  But  said I  I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me ` Oh  said he  ` wait half a minute  till I have finished my job  For  would you believe it  Miss Woodhouse  there he is  in the most obliging manner in the world  fastening in the rivet of my mother  s spectacles  The rivet came out  you know  this morning  So very obliging  For my mother had no use of her spectacles  could not put them on  And  by the bye  every body ought to have two pair of spectacles  they should indeed  Jane said so  I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did  but something or other hindered me all the morning  first one thing  then another  there is no saying what  you know  At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping  Oh  said I  Patty do not come with your bad news to me  Here is the rivet of your mistress  s spectacles out  Then the baked apples came home  Mrs  Wallis sent them by her boy  they are extremely civil and obliging to us  the Wallises  always  I have heard some people say that Mrs  Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer  but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them  And it cannot be for the value of our custom now  for what is our consumption of bread  you know  Only three of us  besides dear Jane at present  and she really eats nothing  makes such a shocking breakfast  you would be quite frightened if you saw it  I dare not let my mother know how little she eats  so I say one thing and then I say another  and it passes off  But about the middle of the day she gets hungry  and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples  and they are extremely wholesome  for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr  Perry  I happened to meet him in the street  Not that I had any doubt before  I have so often heard Mr  Woodhouse recommend a baked apple  I believe it is the only way that Mr  Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome  We have apple  dumplings  however  very often  Patty makes an excellent apple  dumpling  Well  Mrs  Weston  you have prevailed  I hope  and these ladies will oblige us  Emma would be  very happy to wait on Mrs  Bates  & c  and they did at last move out of the shop  with no farther delay from Miss Bates than   How do you do  Mrs  Ford  I beg your pardon  I did not see you before  I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town  Jane came back delighted yesterday  Thank ye  the gloves do very well  only a little too large about the wrist  but Jane is taking them in   What was I talking of  said she  beginning again when they were all in the street  Emma wondered on what  of all the medley  she would fix   I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of  Oh  my mother  s spectacles  So very obliging of Mr  Frank Churchill  ` Oh  said he  ` I do think I can fasten the rivet  I like a job of this kind excessively  Which you know shewed him to be so very     Indeed I must say that  much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected  he very far exceeds any thing     I do congratulate you  Mrs  Weston  most warmly  He seems every thing the fondest parent could     ` Oh  said he  ` I can fasten the rivet  I like a job of that sort excessively  I never shall forget his manner  And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet  and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some  ` Oh  said he directly  ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good  and these are the finest  looking home  baked apples I ever saw in my life  That  you know  was so very     And I am sure  by his manner  it was no compliment  Indeed they are very delightful apples  and Mrs  Wallis does them full justice  only we do not have them baked more than twice  and Mr  Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times  but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it  The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking  beyond a doubt  all from Donwell  some of Mr  Knightley  s most liberal supply  He sends us a sack every year  and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees  I believe there is two of them  My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days  But I was really quite shocked the other day  for Mr  Knightley called one morning  and Jane was eating these apples  and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them  and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock  ` I am sure you must be  said he  ` and I will send you another supply  for I have a great many more than I can ever use  William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year  I will send you some more  before they get good for nothing  So I begged he would not  for really as to ours being gone  I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left  it was but half a dozen indeed  but they should be all kept for Jane  and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more  so liberal as he had been already  and Jane said the same  And when he was gone  she almost quarrelled with me  No  I should not say quarrelled  for we never had a quarrel in our lives  but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone  she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left  Oh  said I  my dear  I did say as much as I could  However  the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples  the same sort of apples  a bushel at least  and I was very much obliged  and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing  as you may suppose  William Larkins is such an old acquaintance  I am always glad to see him  But  however  I found afterwards from Patty  that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had  he had brought them all  and now his master had not one left to bake or boil  William did not seem to mind it himself  he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many  for William  you know  thinks more of his master  s profit than any thing  but Mrs  Hodges  he said  was quite displeased at their being all sent away  She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple  tart this spring  He told Patty this  but bid her not mind it  and be sure not to say any thing to us about it  for Mrs  Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes  and as long as so many sacks were sold  it did not signify who ate the remainder  And so Patty told me  and I was excessively shocked indeed  I would not have Mr  Knightley know any thing about it for the world  He would be so very     I wanted to keep it from Jane  s knowledge  but  unluckily  I had mentioned it before I was aware  Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door  and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to  pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good  will   Pray take care  Mrs  Weston  there is a step at the turning  Pray take care  Miss Woodhouse  ours is rather a dark staircase  rather darker and narrower than one could wish  Miss Smith  pray take care  Miss Woodhouse  I am quite concerned  I am sure you hit your foot  Miss Smith  the step at the turning  CHAPTER X The appearance of the little sitting  room as they entered  was tranquillity itself  Mrs  Bates  deprived of her usual employment  slumbering on one side of the fire  Frank Churchill  at a table near her  most deedily occupied about her spectacles  and Jane Fairfax  standing with her back to them  intent on her pianoforte  Busy as he was  however  the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again   This is a pleasure  said he  in rather a low voice   coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated  You find me trying to be useful  tell me if you think I shall succeed   What  said Mrs  Weston   have not you finished it yet  you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate   I have not been working uninterruptedly  he replied   I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily  it was not quite firm  an unevenness in the floor  I believe  You see we have been wedging one leg with paper  This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come  I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home  He contrived that she should be seated by him  and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her  and trying to make her help or advise him in his work  till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again  That she was not immediately ready  Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves  she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion  she must reason herself into the power of performance  and Emma could not but pity such feelings  whatever their origin  and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again  At last Jane began  and though the first bars were feebly given  the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to  Mrs  Weston had been delighted before  and was delighted again  Emma joined her in all her praise  and the pianoforte  with every proper discrimination  was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise   Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ  said Frank Churchill  with a smile at Emma   the person has not chosen ill  I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell  s taste at Weymouth  and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize  I dare say  Miss Fairfax  that he either gave his friend very minute directions  or wrote to Broadwood himself  Do not you think so  Jane did not look round  She was not obliged to hear  Mrs  Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment   It is not fair  said Emma  in a whisper   mine was a random guess  Do not distress her  He shook his head with a smile  and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy  Soon afterwards he began again   How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion  Miss Fairfax  I dare say they often think of you  and wonder which will be the day  the precise day of the instrument  s coming to hand  Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time  Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him  or that he may have sent only a general direction  an order indefinite as to time  to depend upon contingencies and conveniences  He paused  She could not but hear  she could not avoid answering   Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell  said she  in a voice of forced calmness   I can imagine nothing with any confidence  It must be all conjecture   Conjecture  aye  sometimes one conjectures right  and sometimes one conjectures wrong  I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm  What nonsense one talks  Miss Woodhouse  when hard at work  if one talks at all  your real workmen  I suppose  hold their tongues  but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word  Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing  There  it is done  I have the pleasure  madam   to Mrs  Bates  of restoring your spectacles  healed for the present  He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter  to escape a little from the latter  he went to the pianoforte  and begged Miss Fairfax  who was still sitting at it  to play something more   If you are very kind  said he   it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night  let me live them over again  You did not enjoy them as I did  you appeared tired the whole time  I believe you were glad we danced no longer  but I would have given worlds  all the worlds one ever has to give  for another half  hour  She played   What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy  If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth  She looked up at him for a moment  coloured deeply  and played something else  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte  and turning to Emma  said   Here is something quite new to me  Do you know it  Cramer  And here are a new set of Irish melodies  That  from such a quarter  one might expect  This was all sent with the instrument  Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell  was not it  He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here  I honour that part of the attention particularly  it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart  Nothing hastily done  nothing incomplete  True affection only could have prompted it  Emma wished he would be less pointed  yet could not help being amused  and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile  when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness  there had been a smile of secret delight  she had less scruple in the amusement  and much less compunction with respect to her  This amiable  upright  perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings  He brought all the music to her  and they looked it over together  Emma took the opportunity of whispering   You speak too plain  She must understand you   I hope she does  I would have her understand me  I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning   But really  I am half ashamed  and wish I had never taken up the idea   I am very glad you did  and that you communicated it to me  I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways  Leave shame to her  If she does wrong  she ought to feel it   She is not entirely without it  I think   I do not see much sign of it  She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this moment  _his_ favourite  Shortly afterwards Miss Bates  passing near the window  descried Mr  Knightley on horse  back not far off   Mr  Knightley I declare  I must speak to him if possible  just to thank him  I will not open the window here  it would give you all cold  but I can go into my mother  s room you know  I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here  Quite delightful to have you all meet so  Our little room so honoured  She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke  and opening the casement there  immediately called Mr  Knightley  s attention  and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others  as if it had passed within the same apartment   How d  ye do  how d  ye do  Very well  I thank you  So obliged to you for the carriage last night  We were just in time  my mother just ready for us  Pray come in  do come in  You will find some friends here  So began Miss Bates  and Mr  Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn  for most resolutely and commandingly did he say   How is your niece  Miss Bates  I want to inquire after you all  but particularly your niece  How is Miss Fairfax  I hope she caught no cold last night  How is she to  day  Tell me how Miss Fairfax is  And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else  The listeners were amused  and Mrs  Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning  But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism   So obliged to you  so very much obliged to you for the carriage  resumed Miss Bates  He cut her short with   I am going to Kingston  Can I do any thing for you   Oh  dear  Kingston  are you  Mrs  Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston   Mrs  Cole has servants to send  Can I do any thing for _you_   No  I thank you  But do come in  Who do you think is here  Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith  so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte  Do put up your horse at the Crown  and come in   Well  said he  in a deliberating manner   for five minutes  perhaps   And here is Mrs  Weston and Mr  Frank Churchill too  Quite delightful  so many friends   No  not now  I thank you  I could not stay two minutes  I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can   Oh  do come in  They will be so very happy to see you   No  no  your room is full enough  I will call another day  and hear the pianoforte   Well  I am so sorry  Oh  Mr  Knightley  what a delightful party last night  how extremely pleasant  Did you ever see such dancing  Was not it delightful  Miss Woodhouse and Mr  Frank Churchill  I never saw any thing equal to it   Oh  very delightful indeed  I can say nothing less  for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr  Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes  And  raising his voice still more  I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too  I think Miss Fairfax dances very well  and Mrs  Weston is the very best country  dance player  without exception  in England  Now  if your friends have any gratitude  they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return  but I cannot stay to hear it   Oh  Mr  Knightley  one moment more  something of consequence  so shocked  Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples   What is the matter now   To think of your sending us all your store apples  You said you had a great many  and now you have not one left  We really are so shocked  Mrs  Hodges may well be angry  William Larkins mentioned it here  You should not have done it  indeed you should not  Ah  he is off  He never can bear to be thanked  But I thought he would have staid now  and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned     Well   returning to the room  I have not been able to succeed  Mr  Knightley cannot stop  He is going to Kingston  He asked me if he could do any thing      Yes  said Jane   we heard his kind offers  we heard every thing   Oh  yes  my dear  I dare say you might  because you know  the door was open  and the window was open  and Mr  Knightley spoke loud  You must have heard every thing to be sure  ` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston  said he  so I just mentioned     Oh  Miss Woodhouse  must you be going  You seem but just come  so very obliging of you  Emma found it really time to be at home  the visit had already lasted long  and on examining watches  so much of the morning was perceived to be gone  that Mrs  Weston and her companion taking leave also  could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates  before they set off for Randalls  CHAPTER XI It may be possible to do without dancing entirely  Instances have been known of young people passing many  many months successively  without being at any ball of any description  and no material injury accrue either to body or mind  but when a beginning is made  when the felicities of rapid motion have once been  though slightly  felt  it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more  Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury  and longed to dance again  and the last half  hour of an evening which Mr  Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls  was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject  Frank  s was the first idea  and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it  for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties  and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance  But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced  for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax  and even for simple dancing itself  without any of the wicked aids of vanity  to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold  and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour  in the hope of discovering  in spite of all that Mr  Weston could say of their exactly equal size  that it was a little the largest  His first proposition and request  that the dance begun at Mr  Cole  s should be finished there  that the same party should be collected  and the same musician engaged  met with the readiest acquiescence  Mr  Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment  and Mrs  Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance  and the interesting employment had followed  of reckoning up exactly who there would be  and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple   You and Miss Smith  and Miss Fairfax  will be three  and the two Miss Coxes five  had been repeated many times over   And there will be the two Gilberts  young Cox  my father  and myself  besides Mr  Knightley  Yes  that will be quite enough for pleasure  You and Miss Smith  and Miss Fairfax  will be three  and the two Miss Coxes five  and for five couple there will be plenty of room  But soon it came to be on one side   But will there be good room for five couple  I really do not think there will  On another   And after all  five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up  Five couple are nothing  when one thinks seriously about it  It will not do to _invite_ five couple  It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment  Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother  s  and must be invited with the rest  Somebody else believed _Mrs_  Gilbert would have danced the other evening  if she had been asked  A word was put in for a second young Cox  and at last  Mr  Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included  and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out  it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten  and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of  The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other   Might not they use both rooms  and dance across the passage  It seemed the best scheme  and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better  Emma said it would be awkward  Mrs  Weston was in distress about the supper  and Mr  Woodhouse opposed it earnestly  on the score of health  It made him so very unhappy  indeed  that it could not be persevered in   Oh  no  said he   it would be the extreme of imprudence  I could not bear it for Emma  Emma is not strong  She would catch a dreadful cold  So would poor little Harriet  So you would all  Mrs  Weston  you would be quite laid up  do not let them talk of such a wild thing  Pray do not let them talk of it  That young man  speaking lower  is very thoughtless  Do not tell his father  but that young man is not quite the thing  He has been opening the doors very often this evening  and keeping them open very inconsiderately  He does not think of the draught  I do not mean to set you against him  but indeed he is not quite the thing  Mrs  Weston was sorry for such a charge  She knew the importance of it  and said every thing in her power to do it away  Every door was now closed  the passage plan given up  and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again  and with such good  will on Frank Churchill  s part  that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple  was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten   We were too magnificent  said he   We allowed unnecessary room  Ten couple may stand here very well  Emma demurred   It would be a crowd  a sad crowd  and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in   Very true  he gravely replied   it was very bad  But still he went on measuring  and still he ended with   I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple   No  no  said she   you are quite unreasonable  It would be dreadful to be standing so close  Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd  and a crowd in a little room   There is no denying it  he replied   I agree with you exactly  A crowd in a little room  Miss Woodhouse  you have the art of giving pictures in a few words  Exquisite  quite exquisite  Still  however  having proceeded so far  one is unwilling to give the matter up  It would be a disappointment to my father  and altogether  I do not know that  I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well  Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self  willed  and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her  but she took the compliment  and forgave the rest  Had she intended ever to _marry_ him  it might have been worth while to pause and consider  and try to understand the value of his preference  and the character of his temper  but for all the purposes of their acquaintance  he was quite amiable enough  Before the middle of the next day  he was at Hartfield  and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement   Well  Miss Woodhouse  he almost immediately began   your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away  I hope  by the terrors of my father  s little rooms  I bring a new proposal on the subject  a thought of my father  s  which waits only your approbation to be acted upon  May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball  to be given  not at Randalls  but at the Crown Inn   The Crown   Yes  if you and Mr  Woodhouse see no objection  and I trust you cannot  my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there  Better accommodations  he can promise them  and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls  It is his own idea  Mrs  Weston sees no objection to it  provided you are satisfied  This is what we all feel  Oh  you were perfectly right  Ten couple  in either of the Randalls rooms  would have been insufferable  Dreadful  I felt how right you were the whole time  but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield  Is not it a good exchange  You consent  I hope you consent   It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to  if Mr  and Mrs  Weston do not  I think it admirable  and  as far as I can answer for myself  shall be most happy  It seems the only improvement that could be  Papa  do you not think it an excellent improvement  She was obliged to repeat and explain it  before it was fully comprehended  and then  being quite new  farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable   No  he thought it very far from an improvement  a very bad plan  much worse than the other  A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous  never properly aired  or fit to be inhabited  If they must dance  they had better dance at Randalls  He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life  did not know the people who kept it by sight  Oh  no  a very bad plan  They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere   I was going to observe  sir  said Frank Churchill   that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body  s catching cold  so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls  Mr  Perry might have reason to regret the alteration  but nobody else could   Sir  said Mr  Woodhouse  rather warmly   you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr  Perry to be that sort of character  Mr  Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill  But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father  s house   From the very circumstance of its being larger  sir  We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all  not once the whole evening  and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows  letting in cold air upon heated bodies  which  as you well know  sir  does the mischief   Open the windows  but surely  Mr  Churchill  nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls  Nobody could be so imprudent  I never heard of such a thing  Dancing with open windows  I am sure  neither your father nor Mrs  Weston  poor Miss Taylor that was  would suffer it   Ah  sir  but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window  curtain  and throw up a sash  without its being suspected  I have often known it done myself   Have you indeed  sir  Bless me  I never could have supposed it  But I live out of the world  and am often astonished at what I hear  However  this does make a difference  and  perhaps  when we come to talk it over  but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry  If Mr  and Mrs  Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning  we may talk it over  and see what can be done   But  unfortunately  sir  my time is so limited   Oh  interrupted Emma   there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over  There is no hurry at all  If it can be contrived to be at the Crown  papa  it will be very convenient for the horses  They will be so near their own stable   So they will  my dear  That is a great thing  Not that James ever complains  but it is right to spare our horses when we can  If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired  but is Mrs  Stokes to be trusted  I doubt it  I do not know her  even by sight   I can answer for every thing of that nature  sir  because it will be under Mrs  Weston  s care  Mrs  Weston undertakes to direct the whole   There  papa  Now you must be satisfied  Our own dear Mrs  Weston  who is carefulness itself  Do not you remember what Mr  Perry said  so many years ago  when I had the measles  ` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up  you need not have any fears  sir  How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her   Aye  very true  Mr  Perry did say so  I shall never forget it  Poor little Emma  You were very bad with the measles  that is  you would have been very bad  but for Perry  s great attention  He came four times a day for a week  He said  from the first  it was a very good sort  which was our great comfort  but the measles are a dreadful complaint  I hope whenever poor Isabella  s little ones have the measles  she will send for Perry   My father and Mrs  Weston are at the Crown at this moment  said Frank Churchill   examining the capabilities of the house  I left them there and came on to Hartfield  impatient for your opinion  and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot  I was desired to say so from both  It would be the greatest pleasure to them  if you could allow me to attend you there  They can do nothing satisfactorily without you  Emma was most happy to be called to such a council  and her father  engaging to think it all over while she was gone  the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown  There were Mr  and Mrs  Weston  delighted to see her and receive her approbation  very busy and very happy in their different way  she  in some little distress  and he  finding every thing perfect   Emma  said she   this paper is worse than I expected  Look  in places you see it is dreadfully dirty  and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined   My dear  you are too particular  said her husband   What does all that signify  You will see nothing of it by candlelight  It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight  We never see any thing of it on our club  nights  The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant   Men never know when things are dirty or not  and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself   Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares  One perplexity  however  arose  which the gentlemen did not disdain  It regarded a supper  room  At the time of the ballroom  s being built  suppers had not been in question  and a small card  room adjoining  was the only addition  What was to be done  This card  room would be wanted as a card  room now  or  if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves  still was it not too small for any comfortable supper  Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose  but it was at the other end of the house  and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it  This made a difficulty  Mrs  Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage  and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper  Mrs  Weston proposed having no regular supper  merely sandwiches  & c  set out in the little room  but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion  A private dance  without sitting down to supper  was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women  and Mrs  Weston must not speak of it again  She then took another line of expediency  and looking into the doubtful room  observed   I do not think it _is_ so very small  We shall not be many  you know  And Mr  Weston at the same time  walking briskly with long steps through the passage  was calling out   You talk a great deal of the length of this passage  my dear  It is a mere nothing after all  and not the least draught from the stairs   I wish  said Mrs  Weston   one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best  To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object  if one could but tell what that would be   Yes  very true  cried Frank   very true  You want your neighbours  opinions  I do not wonder at you  If one could ascertain what the chief of them  the Coles  for instance  They are not far off  Shall I call upon them  Or Miss Bates  She is still nearer  And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body  I think we do want a larger council  Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us   Well  if you please  said Mrs  Weston rather hesitating   if you think she will be of any use   You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates  said Emma   She will be all delight and gratitude  but she will tell you nothing  She will not even listen to your questions  I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates   But she is so amusing  so extremely amusing  I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk  And I need not bring the whole family  you know  Here Mr  Weston joined them  and on hearing what was proposed  gave it his decided approbation   Aye  do  Frank  Go and fetch Miss Bates  and let us end the matter at once  She will enjoy the scheme  I am sure  and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties  Fetch Miss Bates  We are growing a little too nice  She is a standing lesson of how to be happy  But fetch them both  Invite them both   Both sir  Can the old lady      The old lady  No  the young lady  to be sure  I shall think you a great blockhead  Frank  if you bring the aunt without the niece   Oh  I beg your pardon  sir  I did not immediately recollect  Undoubtedly if you wish it  I will endeavour to persuade them both  And away he ran  Long before he reappeared  attending the short  neat  brisk  moving aunt  and her elegant niece  Mrs  Weston  like a sweet  tempered woman and a good wife  had examined the passage again  and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before  indeed very trifling  and here ended the difficulties of decision  All the rest  in speculation at least  was perfectly smooth  All the minor arrangements of table and chair  lights and music  tea and supper  made themselves  or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs  Weston and Mrs  Stokes  Every body invited  was certainly to come  Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight  which could not possibly be refused  And a delightful dance it was to be  Most cordially  when Miss Bates arrived  did she agree that it must  As a counsellor she was not wanted  but as an approver   a much safer character  she was truly welcome  Her approbation  at once general and minute  warm and incessant  could not but please  and for another half  hour they were all walking to and fro  between the different rooms  some suggesting  some attending  and all in happy enjoyment of the future  The party did not break up without Emma  s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening  nor without her overhearing Mr  Weston whisper to his wife   He has asked her  my dear  That  s right  I knew he would  CHAPTER XII One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma  its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill  s stay in Surry  for  in spite of Mr  Weston  s confidence  she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight  But this was not judged feasible  The preparations must take their time  nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on  and for a few days they must be planning  proceeding and hoping in uncertainty  at the risk  in her opinion  the great risk  of its being all in vain  Enscombe however was gracious  gracious in fact  if not in word  His wish of staying longer evidently did not please  but it was not opposed  All was safe and prosperous  and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another  Emma  being now certain of her ball  began to adopt as the next vexation Mr  Knightley  s provoking indifference about it  Either because he did not dance himself  or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted  he seemed resolved that it should not interest him  determined against its exciting any present curiosity  or affording him any future amusement  To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply  than   Very well  If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment  I have nothing to say against it  but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me  Oh  yes  I must be there  I could not refuse  and I will keep as much awake as I can  but I would rather be at home  looking over William Larkins  s week  s account  much rather  I confess  Pleasure in seeing dancing  not I  indeed  I never look at it  I do not know who does  Fine dancing  I believe  like virtue  must be its own reward  Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different  This Emma felt was aimed at her  and it made her quite angry  It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent  or so indignant  he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball  for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree  It made her animated  open hearted  she voluntarily said   Oh  Miss Woodhouse  I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball  What a disappointment it would be  I do look forward to it  I own  with _very_ great pleasure  It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins  No  she was more and more convinced that Mrs  Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise  There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side  but no love  Alas  there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr  Knightley  Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over  throw of every thing  A letter arrived from Mr  Churchill to urge his nephew  s instant return  Mrs  Churchill was unwell  far too unwell to do without him  she had been in a very suffering state  so said her husband  when writing to her nephew two days before  though from her usual unwillingness to give pain  and constant habit of never thinking of herself  she had not mentioned it  but now she was too ill to trifle  and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay  The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma  in a note from Mrs  Weston  instantly  As to his going  it was inevitable  He must be gone within a few hours  though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt  to lessen his repugnance  He knew her illnesses  they never occurred but for her own convenience  Mrs  Weston added   that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury  after breakfast  and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him  and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon  This wretched note was the finale of Emma  s breakfast  When once it had been read  there was no doing any thing  but lament and exclaim  The loss of the ball  the loss of the young man  and all that the young man might be feeling  It was too wretched  Such a delightful evening as it would have been  Every body so happy  and she and her partner the happiest  I said it would be so  was the only consolation  Her father  s feelings were quite distinct  He thought principally of Mrs  Churchill  s illness  and wanted to know how she was treated  and as for the ball  it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed  but they would all be safer at home  Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared  but if this reflected at all upon his impatience  his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him  He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it  His dejection was most evident  He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes  and when rousing himself  it was only to say   Of all horrid things  leave  taking is the worst   But you will come again  said Emma   This will not be your only visit to Randalls   Ah  shaking his head  the uncertainty of when I may be able to return  I shall try for it with a zeal  It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares  and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring  but I am afraid  they did not stir last spring  I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever   Our poor ball must be quite given up   Ah  that ball  why did we wait for any thing  why not seize the pleasure at once  How often is happiness destroyed by preparation  foolish preparation  You told us it would be so  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  why are you always so right   Indeed  I am very sorry to be right in this instance  I would much rather have been merry than wise   If I can come again  we are still to have our ball  My father depends on it  Do not forget your engagement  Emma looked graciously   Such a fortnight as it has been  he continued   every day more precious and more delightful than the day before  every day making me less fit to bear any other place  Happy those  who can remain at Highbury   As you do us such ample justice now  said Emma  laughing   I will venture to ask  whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first  Do not we rather surpass your expectations  I am sure we do  I am sure you did not much expect to like us  You would not have been so long in coming  if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury  He laughed rather consciously  and though denying the sentiment  Emma was convinced that it had been so   And you must be off this very morning   Yes  my father is to join me here  we shall walk back together  and I must be off immediately  I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him   Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates  How unlucky  Miss Bates  s powerful  argumentative mind might have strengthened yours   Yes  I _have_ called there  passing the door  I thought it better  It was a right thing to do  I went in for three minutes  and was detained by Miss Bates  s being absent  She was out  and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in  She is a woman that one may  that one _must_ laugh at  but that one would not wish to slight  It was better to pay my visit  then  He hesitated  got up  walked to a window   In short  said he   perhaps  Miss Woodhouse  I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion  He looked at her  as if wanting to read her thoughts  She hardly knew what to say  It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious  which she did not wish  Forcing herself to speak  therefore  in the hope of putting it by  she calmly said   You are quite in the right  it was most natural to pay your visit  then  He was silent  She believed he was looking at her  probably reflecting on what she had said  and trying to understand the manner  She heard him sigh  It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh  He could not believe her to be encouraging him  A few awkward moments passed  and he sat down again  and in a more determined manner said   It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield  My regard for Hartfield is most warm  He stopt again  rose again  and seemed quite embarrassed  He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed  and who can say how it might have ended  if his father had not made his appearance  Mr  Woodhouse soon followed  and the necessity of exertion made him composed  A very few minutes more  however  completed the present trial  Mr  Weston  always alert when business was to be done  and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable  as of foreseeing any that was doubtful  said   It was time to go  and the young man  though he might and did sigh  could not but agree  to take leave   I shall hear about you all  said he   that is my chief consolation  I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you  I have engaged Mrs  Weston to correspond with me  She has been so kind as to promise it  Oh  the blessing of a female correspondent  when one is really interested in the absent  she will tell me every thing  In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again  A very friendly shake of the hand  a very earnest  Good  bye  closed the speech  and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill  Short had been the notice  short their meeting  he was gone  and Emma felt so sorry to part  and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry  and feeling it too much  It was a sad change  They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival  Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks  indescribable spirit  the idea  the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought  the assurance of his attentions  his liveliness  his manners  It had been a very happy fortnight  and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days  To complete every other recommendation  he had _almost_ told her that he loved her  What strength  or what constancy of affection he might be subject to  was another point  but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration  a conscious preference of herself  and this persuasion  joined to all the rest  made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him  in spite of every previous determination against it   I certainly must  said she   This sensation of listlessness  weariness  stupidity  this disinclination to sit down and employ myself  this feeling of every thing  s being dull and insipid about the house  I must be in love  I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not  for a few weeks at least  Well  evil to some is always good to others  I shall have many fellow  mourners for the ball  if not for Frank Churchill  but Mr  Knightley will be happy  He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes  Mr  Knightley  however  shewed no triumphant happiness  He could not say that he was sorry on his own account  his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had  but he said  and very steadily  that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others  and with considerable kindness added   You  Emma  who have so few opportunities of dancing  you are really out of luck  you are very much out of luck  It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax  to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change  but when they did meet  her composure was odious  She had been particularly unwell  however  suffering from headache to a degree  which made her aunt declare  that had the ball taken place  she did not think Jane could have attended it  and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill  health  CHAPTER XIII Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love  Her ideas only varied as to the how much  At first  she thought it was a good deal  and afterwards  but little  She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of  and  for his sake  greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr  and Mrs  Weston  she was very often thinking of him  and quite impatient for a letter  that she might know how he was  how were his spirits  how was his aunt  and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring  But  on the other hand  she could not admit herself to be unhappy  nor  after the first morning  to be less disposed for employment than usual  she was still busy and cheerful  and  pleasing as he was  she could yet imagine him to have faults  and farther  though thinking of him so much  and  as she sat drawing or working  forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment  fancying interesting dialogues  and inventing elegant letters  the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_  Their affection was always to subside into friendship  Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting  but still they were to part  When she became sensible of this  it struck her that she could not be very much in love  for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father  never to marry  a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings   I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_  said she   In not one of all my clever replies  my delicate negatives  is there any allusion to making a sacrifice  I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness  So much the better  I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do  I am quite enough in love  I should be sorry to be more  Upon the whole  she was equally contented with her view of his feelings   _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love  every thing denotes it  very much in love indeed  and when he comes again  if his affection continue  I must be on my guard not to encourage it  It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise  as my own mind is quite made up  Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto  No  if he had believed me at all to share his feelings  he would not have been so wretched  Could he have thought himself encouraged  his looks and language at parting would have been different  Still  however  I must be on my guard  This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is  but I do not know that I expect it will  I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man  I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy  His feelings are warm  but I can imagine them rather changeable  Every consideration of the subject  in short  makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved  I shall do very well again after a little while  and then  it will be a good thing over  for they say every body is in love once in their lives  and I shall have been let off easily  When his letter to Mrs  Weston arrived  Emma had the perusal of it  and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations  and think she had undervalued their strength  It was a long  well  written letter  giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings  expressing all the affection  gratitude  and respect which was natural and honourable  and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive  with spirit and precision  No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern  it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs  Weston  and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe  the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt  and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety  The charm of her own name was not wanting  _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once  and never without a something of pleasing connexion  either a compliment to her taste  or a remembrance of what she had said  and in the very last time of its meeting her eye  unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry  she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed  Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words  I had not a spare moment on Tuesday  as you know  for Miss Woodhouse  s beautiful little friend  Pray make my excuses and adieus to her  This  Emma could not doubt  was all for herself  Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend  His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated  Mrs  Churchill was recovering  and he dared not yet  even in his own imagination  fix a time for coming to Randalls again  Gratifying  however  and stimulative as was the letter in the material part  its sentiments  she yet found  when it was folded up and returned to Mrs  Weston  that it had not added any lasting warmth  that she could still do without the writer  and that he must learn to do without her  Her intentions were unchanged  Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness  His recollection of Harriet  and the words which clothed it  the  beautiful little friend  suggested to her the idea of Harriet  s succeeding her in his affections  Was it impossible  No  Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding  but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner  and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour  For Harriet  it would be advantageous and delightful indeed   I must not dwell upon it  said she  I must not think of it  I know the danger of indulging such speculations  But stranger things have happened  and when we cease to care for each other as we do now  it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure  It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet  s behalf  though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom  for evil in that quarter was at hand  As Frank Churchill  s arrival had succeeded Mr  Elton  s engagement in the conversation of Highbury  as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first  so now upon Frank Churchill  s disappearance  Mr  Elton  s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form  His wedding  day was named  He would soon be among them again  Mr  Elton and his bride  There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before  Mr  Elton and his bride  was in every body  s mouth  and Frank Churchill was forgotten  Emma grew sick at the sound  She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr  Elton  and Harriet  s mind  she had been willing to hope  had been lately gaining strength  With Mr  Weston  s ball in view at least  there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things  but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach  new carriage  bell  ringing  and all  Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her  that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience  but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect  for ever agreed to  without being able to make their opinions the same  Harriet listened submissively  and said  it was very true  it was just as Miss Woodhouse described  it was not worth while to think about them  and she would not think about them any longer  but no change of subject could avail  and the next half  hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before  At last Emma attacked her on another ground   Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr  Elton  s marrying  Harriet  is the strongest reproach you can make _me_  You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into  It was all my doing  I know  I have not forgotten it  I assure you  Deceived myself  I did very miserably deceive you  and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever  Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it  Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation  Emma continued   I have not said  exert yourself Harriet for my sake  think less  talk less of Mr  Elton for my sake  because for your own sake rather  I would wish it to be done  for the sake of what is more important than my comfort  a habit of self  command in you  a consideration of what is your duty  an attention to propriety  an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others  to save your health and credit  and restore your tranquillity  These are the motives which I have been pressing on you  They are very important  and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them  My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration  I want you to save yourself from greater pain  Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due  or rather what would be kind by me  This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest  The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse  whom she really loved extremely  made her wretched for a while  and when the violence of grief was comforted away  still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably   You  who have been the best friend I ever had in my life  Want gratitude to you  Nobody is equal to you  I care for nobody as I do for you  Oh  Miss Woodhouse  how ungrateful I have been  Such expressions  assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do  made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well  nor valued her affection so highly before   There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart  said she afterwards to herself   There is nothing to be compared to it  Warmth and tenderness of heart  with an affectionate  open manner  will beat all the clearness of head in the world  for attraction  I am sure it will  It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved  which gives Isabella all her popularity  I have it not  but I know how to prize and respect it  Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives  Dear Harriet  I would not change you for the clearest  headed  longest  sighted  best  judging female breathing  Oh  the coldness of a Jane Fairfax  Harriet is worth a hundred such  And for a wife  a sensible man  s wife  it is invaluable  I mention no names  but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet  CHAPTER XIV Mrs  Elton was first seen at church  but though devotion might be interrupted  curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew  and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid  to settle whether she were very pretty indeed  or only rather pretty  or not pretty at all  Emma had feelings  less of curiosity than of pride or propriety  to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects  and she made a point of Harriet  s going with her  that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible  She could not enter the house again  could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago  to lace up her boot  without _recollecting_  A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur  Compliments  charades  and horrible blunders  and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too  but she behaved very well  and was only rather pale and silent  The visit was of course short  and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it  that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady  and on no account to give one  beyond the nothing  meaning terms of being  elegantly dressed  and very pleasing  She did not really like her  She would not be in a hurry to find fault  but she suspected that there was no elegance  ease  but not elegance  She was almost sure that for a young woman  a stranger  a bride  there was too much ease  Her person was rather good  her face not unpretty  but neither feature  nor air  nor voice  nor manner  were elegant  Emma thought at least it would turn out so  As for Mr  Elton  his manners did not appear  but no  she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners  It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits  and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it  The woman was better off  she might have the assistance of fine clothes  and the privilege of bashfulness  but the man had only his own good sense to depend on  and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr  Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married  the woman he had wanted to marry  and the woman whom he had been expected to marry  she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise  and to be as much affectedly  and as little really easy as could be   Well  Miss Woodhouse  said Harriet  when they had quitted the house  and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin   Well  Miss Woodhouse   with a gentle sigh  what do you think of her  Is not she very charming  There was a little hesitation in Emma  s answer   Oh  yes  very  a very pleasing young woman   I think her beautiful  quite beautiful   Very nicely dressed  indeed  a remarkably elegant gown   I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love   Oh  no  there is nothing to surprize one at all  A pretty fortune  and she came in his way   I dare say  returned Harriet  sighing again   I dare say she was very much attached to him   Perhaps she might  but it is not every man  s fate to marry the woman who loves him best  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home  and thought this the best offer she was likely to have   Yes  said Harriet earnestly   and well she might  nobody could ever have a better  Well  I wish them happy with all my heart  And now  Miss Woodhouse  I do not think I shall mind seeing them again  He is just as superior as ever  but being married  you know  it is quite a different thing  No  indeed  Miss Woodhouse  you need not be afraid  I can sit and admire him now without any great misery  To know that he has not thrown himself away  is such a comfort  She does seem a charming young woman  just what he deserves  Happy creature  He called her ` Augusta  How delightful  When the visit was returned  Emma made up her mind  She could then see more and judge better  From Harriet  s happening not to be at Hartfield  and her father  s being present to engage Mr  Elton  she had a quarter of an hour of the lady  s conversation to herself  and could composedly attend to her  and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs  Elton was a vain woman  extremely well satisfied with herself  and thinking much of her own importance  that she meant to shine and be very superior  but with manners which had been formed in a bad school  pert and familiar  that all her notions were drawn from one set of people  and one style of living  that if not foolish she was ignorant  and that her society would certainly do Mr  Elton no good  Harriet would have been a better match  If not wise or refined herself  she would have connected him with those who were  but Miss Hawkins  it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit  had been the best of her own set  The rich brother  in  law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance  and his place and his carriages were the pride of him  The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove   My brother Mr  Suckling  s seat  a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove  The grounds of Hartfield were small  but neat and pretty  and the house was modern and well  built  Mrs  Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room  the entrance  and all that she could see or imagine   Very like Maple Grove indeed  She was quite struck by the likeness  That room was the very shape and size of the morning  room at Maple Grove  her sister  s favourite room  Mr  Elton was appealed to  Was not it astonishingly like  She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove   And the staircase  You know  as I came in  I observed how very like the staircase was  placed exactly in the same part of the house  I really could not help exclaiming  I assure you  Miss Woodhouse  it is very delightful to me  to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove  I have spent so many happy months there   with a little sigh of sentiment  A charming place  undoubtedly  Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty  but to me  it has been quite a home  Whenever you are transplanted  like me  Miss Woodhouse  you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind  I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony  Emma made as slight a reply as she could  but it was fully sufficient for Mrs  Elton  who only wanted to be talking herself   So extremely like Maple Grove  And it is not merely the house  the grounds  I assure you  as far as I could observe  are strikingly like  The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here  and stand very much in the same way  just across the lawn  and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree  with a bench round it  which put me so exactly in mind  My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place  People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style  Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment  She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else  but it was not worth while to attack an error so double  dyed  and therefore only said in reply   When you have seen more of this country  I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield  Surry is full of beauties   Oh  yes  I am quite aware of that  It is the garden of England  you know  Surry is the garden of England   Yes  but we must not rest our claims on that distinction  Many counties  I believe  are called the garden of England  as well as Surry   No  I fancy not  replied Mrs  Elton  with a most satisfied smile  I never heard any county but Surry called so  Emma was silenced   My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring  or summer at farthest  continued Mrs  Elton   and that will be our time for exploring  While they are with us  we shall explore a great deal  I dare say  They will have their barouche  landau  of course  which holds four perfectly  and therefore  without saying any thing of _our_ carriage  we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well  They would hardly come in their chaise  I think  at that season of the year  Indeed  when the time draws on  I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche  landau  it will be so very much preferable  When people come into a beautiful country of this sort  you know  Miss Woodhouse  one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible  and Mr  Suckling is extremely fond of exploring  We explored to King  s  Weston twice last summer  in that way  most delightfully  just after their first having the barouche  landau  You have many parties of that kind here  I suppose  Miss Woodhouse  every summer   No  not immediately here  We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of  and we are a very quiet set of people  I believe  more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure   Ah  there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort  Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am  I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove  Many a time has Selina said  when she has been going to Bristol  ` I really cannot get this girl to move from the house  I absolutely must go in by myself  though I hate being stuck up in the barouche  landau without a companion  but Augusta  I believe  with her own good  will  would never stir beyond the park paling  Many a time has she said so  and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion  I think  on the contrary  when people shut themselves up entirely from society  it is a very bad thing  and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree  without living in it either too much or too little  I perfectly understand your situation  however  Miss Woodhouse   looking towards Mr  Woodhouse  Your father  s state of health must be a great drawback  Why does not he try Bath  Indeed he should  Let me recommend Bath to you  I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr  Woodhouse good   My father tried it more than once  formerly  but without receiving any benefit  and Mr  Perry  whose name  I dare say  is not unknown to you  does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now   Ah  that  s a great pity  for I assure you  Miss Woodhouse  where the waters do agree  it is quite wonderful the relief they give  In my Bath life  I have seen such instances of it  And it is so cheerful a place  that it could not fail of being of use to Mr  Woodhouse  s spirits  which  I understand  are sometimes much depressed  And as to its recommendations to _you_  I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them  The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood  It would be a charming introduction for you  who have lived so secluded a life  and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place  A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance  and my particular friend  Mrs  Partridge  the lady I have always resided with when in Bath  would be most happy to shew you any attentions  and would be the very person for you to go into public with  It was as much as Emma could bear  without being impolite  The idea of her being indebted to Mrs  Elton for what was called an _introduction_  of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs  Elton  s  probably some vulgar  dashing widow  who  with the help of a boarder  just made a shift to live  The dignity of Miss Woodhouse  of Hartfield  was sunk indeed  She restrained herself  however  from any of the reproofs she could have given  and only thanked Mrs  Elton coolly   but their going to Bath was quite out of the question  and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father  And then  to prevent farther outrage and indignation  changed the subject directly   I do not ask whether you are musical  Mrs  Elton  Upon these occasions  a lady  s character generally precedes her  and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer   Oh  no  indeed  I must protest against any such idea  A superior performer  very far from it  I assure you  Consider from how partial a quarter your information came  I am doatingly fond of music  passionately fond  and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste  but as to any thing else  upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree  You  Miss Woodhouse  I well know  play delightfully  I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction  comfort  and delight to me  to hear what a musical society I am got into  I absolutely cannot do without music  It is a necessary of life to me  and having always been used to a very musical society  both at Maple Grove and in Bath  it would have been a most serious sacrifice  I honestly said as much to Mr  E  when he was speaking of my future home  and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable  and the inferiority of the house too  knowing what I had been accustomed to  of course he was not wholly without apprehension  When he was speaking of it in that way  I honestly said that _the_ _world_ I could give up  parties  balls  plays  for I had no fear of retirement  Blessed with so many resources within myself  the world was not necessary to _me_  I could do very well without it  To those who had no resources it was a different thing  but my resources made me quite independent  And as to smaller  sized rooms than I had been used to  I really could not give it a thought  I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description  Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove  but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness  nor were spacious apartments  ` But  said I  ` to be quite honest  I do not think I can live without something of a musical society  I condition for nothing else  but without music  life would be a blank to me   We cannot suppose  said Emma  smiling   that Mr  Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury  and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned  in consideration of the motive   No  indeed  I have no doubts at all on that head  I am delighted to find myself in such a circle  I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together  I think  Miss Woodhouse  you and I must establish a musical club  and have regular weekly meetings at your house  or ours  Will not it be a good plan  If _we_ exert ourselves  I think we shall not be long in want of allies  Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_  as an inducement to keep me in practice  for married women  you know  there is a sad story against them  in general  They are but too apt to give up music   But you  who are so extremely fond of it  there can be no danger  surely   I should hope not  but really when I look around among my acquaintance  I tremble  Selina has entirely given up music  never touches the instrument  though she played sweetly  And the same may be said of Mrs  Jeffereys  Clara Partridge  that was  and of the two Milmans  now Mrs  Bird and Mrs  James Cooper  and of more than I can enumerate  Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright  I used to be quite angry with Selina  but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention  I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper   But every thing of that kind  said Emma   will soon be in so regular a train   Well  said Mrs  Elton  laughing   we shall see  Emma  finding her so determined upon neglecting her music  had nothing more to say  and  after a moment  s pause  Mrs  Elton chose another subject   We have been calling at Randalls  said she   and found them both at home  and very pleasant people they seem to be  I like them extremely  Mr  Weston seems an excellent creature  quite a first  rate favourite with me already  I assure you  And _she_ appears so truly good  there is something so motherly and kind  hearted about her  that it wins upon one directly  She was your governess  I think  Emma was almost too much astonished to answer  but Mrs  Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on   Having understood as much  I was rather astonished to find her so very lady  like  But she is really quite the gentlewoman   Mrs  Weston  s manners  said Emma   were always particularly good  Their propriety  simplicity  and elegance  would make them the safest model for any young woman   And who do you think came in while we were there  Emma was quite at a loss  The tone implied some old acquaintance  and how could she possibly guess   Knightley  continued Mrs  Elton   Knightley himself  Was not it lucky  for  not being within when he called the other day  I had never seen him before  and of course  as so particular a friend of Mr  E  s  I had a great curiosity  ` My friend Knightley  had been so often mentioned  that I was really impatient to see him  and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend  Knightley is quite the gentleman  I like him very much  Decidedly  I think  a very gentleman  like man  Happily  it was now time to be gone  They were off  and Emma could breathe   Insufferable woman  was her immediate exclamation   Worse than I had supposed  Absolutely insufferable  Knightley  I could not have believed it  Knightley  never seen him in her life before  and call him Knightley  and discover that he is a gentleman  A little upstart  vulgar being  with her Mr  E  and her _caro_ _sposo_  and her resources  and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery  Actually to discover that Mr  Knightley is a gentleman  I doubt whether he will return the compliment  and discover her to be a lady  I could not have believed it  And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club  One would fancy we were bosom friends  And Mrs  Weston  Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman  Worse and worse  I never met with her equal  Much beyond my hopes  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison  Oh  what would Frank Churchill say to her  if he were here  How angry and how diverted he would be  Ah  there I am  thinking of him directly  Always the first person to be thought of  How I catch myself out  Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind  All this ran so glibly through her thoughts  that by the time her father had arranged himself  after the bustle of the Eltons  departure  and was ready to speak  she was very tolerably capable of attending   Well  my dear  he deliberately began   considering we never saw her before  she seems a very pretty sort of young lady  and I dare say she was very much pleased with you  She speaks a little too quick  A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear  But I believe I am nice  I do not like strange voices  and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor  However  she seems a very obliging  pretty  behaved young lady  and no doubt will make him a very good wife  Though I think he had better not have married  I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs  Elton on this happy occasion  I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer  But I ought to have gone before  Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss  Ah  it shews what a sad invalid I am  But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane   I dare say your apologies were accepted  sir  Mr  Elton knows you   Yes  but a young lady  a bride  I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible  It was being very deficient   But  my dear papa  you are no friend to matrimony  and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_  It ought to be no recommendation to _you_  It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them   No  my dear  I never encouraged any body to marry  but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady  and a bride  especially  is never to be neglected  More is avowedly due to _her_  A bride  you know  my dear  is always the first in company  let the others be who they may   Well  papa  if this is not encouragement to marry  I do not know what is  And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity  baits for poor young ladies   My dear  you do not understand me  This is a matter of mere common politeness and good  breeding  and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry  Emma had done  Her father was growing nervous  and could not understand _her_  Her mind returned to Mrs  Elton  s offences  and long  very long  did they occupy her  CHAPTER XV Emma was not required  by any subsequent discovery  to retract her ill opinion of Mrs  Elton  Her observation had been pretty correct  Such as Mrs  Elton appeared to her on this second interview  such she appeared whenever they met again  self  important  presuming  familiar  ignorant  and ill  bred  She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment  but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world  to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood  and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs  Elton  s consequence only could surpass  There was no reason to suppose Mr  Elton thought at all differently from his wife  He seemed not merely happy with her  but proud  He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury  as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal  and the greater part of her new acquaintance  disposed to commend  or not in the habit of judging  following the lead of Miss Bates  s good  will  or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself  were very well satisfied  so that Mrs  Elton  s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do  unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse  who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being  very pleasant and very elegantly dressed  In one respect Mrs  Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first  Her feelings altered towards Emma  Offended  probably  by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with  she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant  and though the effect was agreeable  the ill  will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma  s dislike  Her manners  too  and Mr  Elton  s  were unpleasant towards Harriet  They were sneering and negligent  Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet  s cure  but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much  It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet  s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve  and her own share in the story  under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him  had in all likelihood been given also  She was  of course  the object of their joint dislike  When they had nothing else to say  it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse  and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her  found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet  Mrs  Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax  and from the first  Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other  but from the very first  and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration  but without solicitation  or plea  or privilege  she must be wanting to assist and befriend her  Before Emma had forfeited her confidence  and about the third time of their meeting  she heard all Mrs  Elton  s knight  errantry on the subject   Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming  Miss Woodhouse  I quite rave about Jane Fairfax  A sweet  interesting creature  So mild and ladylike  and with such talents  I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents  I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well  I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point  Oh  she is absolutely charming  You will laugh at my warmth  but  upon my word  I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax  And her situation is so calculated to affect one  Miss Woodhouse  we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her  We must bring her forward  Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown  I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet  ` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen  ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air  We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax   I cannot think there is any danger of it  was Emma  s calm answer   and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax  s situation and understand what her home has been  with Colonel and Mrs  Campbell  I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown   Oh  but dear Miss Woodhouse  she is now in such retirement  such obscurity  so thrown away  Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end  And I think she feels it  I am sure she does  She is very timid and silent  One can see that she feels the want of encouragement  I like her the better for it  I must confess it is a recommendation to me  I am a great advocate for timidity  and I am sure one does not often meet with it  But in those who are at all inferior  it is extremely prepossessing  Oh  I assure you  Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character  and interests me more than I can express   You appear to feel a great deal  but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax  s acquaintance here  any of those who have known her longer than yourself  can shew her any other attention than   My dear Miss Woodhouse  a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act  You and I need not be afraid  If _we_ set the example  many will follow it as far as they can  though all have not our situations  _We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home  and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax  at any time  the least inconvenient  I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner  as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it  I have no idea of that sort of thing  It is not likely that I _should_  considering what I have been used to  My greatest danger  perhaps  in housekeeping  may be quite the other way  in doing too much  and being too careless of expense  Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be  for we do not at all affect to equal my brother  Mr  Suckling  in income  However  my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax  I shall certainly have her very often at my house  shall introduce her wherever I can  shall have musical parties to draw out her talents  and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation  My acquaintance is so very extensive  that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly  I shall introduce her  of course  very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us  I am sure they will like her extremely  and when she gets a little acquainted with them  her fears will completely wear off  for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating  I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me  and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche  landau in some of our exploring parties   Poor Jane Fairfax  thought Emma  You have not deserved this  You may have done wrong with regard to Mr  Dixon  but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited  The kindness and protection of Mrs  Elton ` Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax  Heavens  Let me not suppose that she dares go about  Emma Woodhouse  ing me  But upon my honour  there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman  s tongue  Emma had not to listen to such paradings again  to any so exclusively addressed to herself  so disgustingly decorated with a  dear Miss Woodhouse  The change on Mrs  Elton  s side soon afterwards appeared  and she was left in peace  neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs  Elton  nor  under Mrs  Elton  s guidance  the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax  and only sharing with others in a general way  in knowing what was felt  what was meditated  what was done  She looked on with some amusement  Miss Bates  s gratitude for Mrs  Elton  s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth  She was quite one of her worthies  the most amiable  affable  delightful woman  just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs  Elton meant to be considered  Emma  s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs  Elton as she seemed to do  She heard of her walking with the Eltons  sitting with the Eltons  spending a day with the Eltons  This was astonishing  She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer   She is a riddle  quite a riddle  said she  To chuse to remain here month after month  under privations of every sort  And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs  Elton  s notice and the penury of her conversation  rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real  generous affection  Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months  the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months  but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer  and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there  According to Miss Bates  it all came from her  Mrs  Dixon had written most pressingly  Would Jane but go  means were to be found  servants sent  friends contrived  no travelling difficulty allowed to exist  but still she had declined it   She must have some motive  more powerful than appears  for refusing this invitation  was Emma  s conclusion   She must be under some sort of penance  inflicted either by the Campbells or herself  There is great fear  great caution  great resolution somewhere  She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_  The decree is issued by somebody  But why must she consent to be with the Eltons  Here is quite a separate puzzle  Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject  before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs  Elton  Mrs  Weston ventured this apology for Jane   We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage  my dear Emma  but it is better than being always at home  Her aunt is a good creature  but  as a constant companion  must be very tiresome  We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits  before we condemn her taste for what she goes to   You are right  Mrs  Weston  said Mr  Knightley warmly   Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs  Elton  Could she have chosen with whom to associate  she would not have chosen her  But  with a reproachful smile at Emma  she receives attentions from Mrs  Elton  which nobody else pays her  Emma felt that Mrs  Weston was giving her a momentary glance  and she was herself struck by his warmth  With a faint blush  she presently replied   Such attentions as Mrs  Elton  s  I should have imagined  would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax  Mrs  Elton  s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting   I should not wonder  said Mrs  Weston   if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination  by her aunt  s eagerness in accepting Mrs  Elton  s civilities for her  Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated  in spite of the very natural wish of a little change  Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again  and after a few minutes silence  he said   Another thing must be taken into consideration too  Mrs  Elton does not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her  We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou  the plainest spoken amongst us  we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other  a something more early implanted  We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before  We feel things differently  And besides the operation of this  as a general principle  you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs  Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner  and that  face to face  Mrs  Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to  Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs  Elton  s way before  and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action  if not in consciousness   I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax  said Emma  Little Henry was in her thoughts  and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say   Yes  he replied   any body may know how highly I think of her   And yet  said Emma  beginning hastily and with an arch look  but soon stopping  it was better  however  to know the worst at once  she hurried on  And yet  perhaps  you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is  The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other  Mr  Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters  and either the exertion of getting them together  or some other cause  brought the colour into his face  as he answered   Oh  are you there  But you are miserably behindhand  Mr  Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago  He stopped  Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs  Weston  and did not herself know what to think  In a moment he went on   That will never be  however  I can assure you  Miss Fairfax  I dare say  would not have me if I were to ask her  and I am very sure I shall never ask her  Emma returned her friend  s pressure with interest  and was pleased enough to exclaim   You are not vain  Mr  Knightley  I will say that for you  He seemed hardly to hear her  he was thoughtful  and in a manner which shewed him not pleased  soon afterwards said   So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax   No indeed I have not  You have scolded me too much for match  making  for me to presume to take such a liberty with you  What I said just now  meant nothing  One says those sort of things  of course  without any idea of a serious meaning  Oh  no  upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body  You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way  if you were married  Mr  Knightley was thoughtful again  The result of his reverie was   No  Emma  I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize  I never had a thought of her in that way  I assure you  And soon afterwards   Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman  but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect  She has a fault  She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife  Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault   Well  said she   and you soon silenced Mr  Cole  I suppose   Yes  very soon  He gave me a quiet hint  I told him he was mistaken  he asked my pardon and said no more  Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours   In that respect how unlike dear Mrs  Elton  who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world  I wonder how she speaks of the Coles  what she calls them  How can she find any appellation for them  deep enough in familiar vulgarity  She calls you  Knightley  what can she do for Mr  Cole  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her  Mrs  Weston  your argument weighs most with me  I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates  than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax  s mind over Mrs  Elton  I have no faith in Mrs  Elton  s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought  word  or deed  or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good  breeding  I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise  encouragement  and offers of service  that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions  from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche  landau   Jane Fairfax has feeling  said Mr  Knightley  I do not accuse her of want of feeling  Her sensibilities  I suspect  are strong  and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance  patience  self  controul  but it wants openness  She is reserved  more reserved  I think  than she used to be  And I love an open temper  No  till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment  it had never entered my head  I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her  with admiration and pleasure always  but with no thought beyond   Well  Mrs  Weston  said Emma triumphantly when he left them   what do you say now to Mr  Knightley  s marrying Jane Fairfax   Why  really  dear Emma  I say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of _not_ being in love with her  that I should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last  Do not beat me  CHAPTER XVI Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr  Elton  was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage  Dinner  parties and evening  parties were made for him and his lady  and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day   I see how it is  said she   I see what a life I am to lead among you  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated  We really seem quite the fashion  If this is living in the country  it is nothing very formidable  From Monday next to Saturday  I assure you we have not a disengaged day  A woman with fewer resources than I have  need not have been at a loss  No invitation came amiss to her  Her Bath habits made evening  parties perfectly natural to her  and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners  She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms  at the poor attempt at rout  cakes  and there being no ice in the Highbury card  parties  Mrs  Bates  Mrs  Perry  Mrs  Goddard and others  were a good deal behind  hand in knowledge of the world  but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged  In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party  in which her card  tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style  and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish  to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour  and in the proper order  Emma  in the meanwhile  could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons  They must not do less than others  or she should be exposed to odious suspicions  and imagined capable of pitiful resentment  A dinner there must be  After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes  Mr  Woodhouse felt no unwillingness  and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself  with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him  The persons to be invited  required little thought  Besides the Eltons  it must be the Westons and Mr  Knightley  so far it was all of course  and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth  but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction  and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet  s begging to be allowed to decline it   She would rather not be in his company more than she could help  She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together  without feeling uncomfortable  If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased  she would rather stay at home  It was precisely what Emma would have wished  had she deemed it possible enough for wishing  She was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend  for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home  and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth  Jane Fairfax  Since her last conversation with Mrs  Weston and Mr  Knightley  she was more conscience  stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often been  Mr  Knightley  s words dwelt with her  He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs  Elton which nobody else paid her   This is very true  said she   at least as far as relates to me  which was all that was meant  and it is very shameful  Of the same age  and always knowing her  I ought to have been more her friend  She will never like me now  I have neglected her too long  But I will shew her greater attention than I have done  Every invitation was successful  They were all disengaged and all happy  The preparatory interest of this dinner  however  was not yet over  A circumstance rather unlucky occurred  The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring  and their papa now proposed bringing them  and staying one whole day at Hartfield  which one day would be the very day of this party  His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off  but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so  Mr  Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear  and here would be a ninth  and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty  eight hours without falling in with a dinner  party  She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself  by representing that though he certainly would make them nine  yet he always said so little  that the increase of noise would be very immaterial  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself  to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother  The event was more favourable to Mr  Woodhouse than to Emma  John Knightley came  but Mr  Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day  He might be able to join them in the evening  but certainly not to dinner  Mr  Woodhouse was quite at ease  and the seeing him so  with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate  removed the chief of even Emma  s vexation  The day came  the party were punctually assembled  and Mr  John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable  Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner  he was talking to Miss Fairfax  Mrs  Elton  as elegant as lace and pearls could make her  he looked at in silence  wanting only to observe enough for Isabella  s information  but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl  and he could talk to her  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys  when it had been just beginning to rain  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject  and he said   I hope you did not venture far  Miss Fairfax  this morning  or I am sure you must have been wet  We scarcely got home in time  I hope you turned directly   I went only to the post  office  said she   and reached home before the rain was much  It is my daily errand  I always fetch the letters when I am here  It saves trouble  and is a something to get me out  A walk before breakfast does me good   Not a walk in the rain  I should imagine   No  but it did not absolutely rain when I set out  Mr  John Knightley smiled  and replied   That is to say  you chose to have your walk  for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you  and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before  The post  office has a great charm at one period of our lives  When you have lived to my age  you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for  There was a little blush  and then this answer   I must not hope to be ever situated as you are  in the midst of every dearest connexion  and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters   Indifferent  Oh  no  I never conceived you could become indifferent  Letters are no matter of indifference  they are generally a very positive curse   You are speaking of letters of business  mine are letters of friendship   I have often thought them the worst of the two  replied he coolly   Business  you know  may bring money  but friendship hardly ever does   Ah  you are not serious now  I know Mr  John Knightley too well  I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you  much less than to me  but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference  it is not age  but situation  You have every body dearest to you always at hand  I  probably  never shall again  and therefore till I have outlived all my affections  a post  office  I think  must always have power to draw me out  in worse weather than to  day   When I talked of your being altered by time  by the progress of years  said John Knightley   I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings  I consider one as including the other  Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle  but that is not the change I had in view for you  As an old friend  you will allow me to hope  Miss Fairfax  that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have  It was kindly said  and very far from giving offence  A pleasant  thank you  seemed meant to laugh it off  but a blush  a quivering lip  a tear in the eye  shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh  Her attention was now claimed by Mr  Woodhouse  who being  according to his custom on such occasions  making the circle of his guests  and paying his particular compliments to the ladies  was ending with her  and with all his mildest urbanity  said   I am very sorry to hear  Miss Fairfax  of your being out this morning in the rain  Young ladies should take care of themselves  Young ladies are delicate plants  They should take care of their health and their complexion  My dear  did you change your stockings   Yes  sir  I did indeed  and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me   My dear Miss Fairfax  young ladies are very sure to be cared for  I hope your good grand  mama and aunt are well  They are some of my very old friends  I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour  You do us a great deal of honour to  day  I am sure  My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness  and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield  The kind  hearted  polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty  and made every fair lady welcome and easy  By this time  the walk in the rain had reached Mrs  Elton  and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane   My dear Jane  what is this I hear  Going to the post  office in the rain  This must not be  I assure you  You sad girl  how could you do such a thing  It is a sign I was not there to take care of you  Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold   Oh  do not tell _me_  You really are a very sad girl  and do not know how to take care of yourself  To the post  office indeed  Mrs  Weston  did you ever hear the like  You and I must positively exert our authority   My advice  said Mrs  Weston kindly and persuasively   I certainly do feel tempted to give  Miss Fairfax  you must not run such risks  Liable as you have been to severe colds  indeed you ought to be particularly careful  especially at this time of year  The spring I always think requires more than common care  Better wait an hour or two  or even half a day for your letters  than run the risk of bringing on your cough again  Now do not you feel that you had  Yes  I am sure you are much too reasonable  You look as if you would not do such a thing again   Oh  she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again  eagerly rejoined Mrs  Elton   We will not allow her to do such a thing again  and nodding significantly  there must be some arrangement made  there must indeed  I shall speak to Mr  E  The man who fetches our letters every morning  one of our men  I forget his name  shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you  That will obviate all difficulties you know  and from _us_ I really think  my dear Jane  you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation   You are extremely kind  said Jane   but I cannot give up my early walk  I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can  I must walk somewhere  and the post  office is an object  and upon my word  I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before   My dear Jane  say no more about it  The thing is determined  that is  laughing affectedly  as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master  You know  Mrs  Weston  you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves  But I do flatter myself  my dear Jane  that my influence is not entirely worn out  If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore  consider that point as settled   Excuse me  said Jane earnestly   I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement  so needlessly troublesome to your servant  If the errand were not a pleasure to me  it could be done  as it always is when I am not here  by my grandmama  s   Oh  my dear  but so much as Patty has to do  And it is a kindness to employ our men  Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered  but instead of answering  she began speaking again to Mr  John Knightley   The post  office is a wonderful establishment  said she   The regularity and despatch of it  If one thinks of all that it has to do  and all that it does so well  it is really astonishing   It is certainly very well regulated   So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears  So seldom that a letter  among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom  is even carried wrong  and not one in a million  I suppose  actually lost  And when one considers the variety of hands  and of bad hands too  that are to be deciphered  it increases the wonder   The clerks grow expert from habit  They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand  and exercise improves them  If you want any farther explanation  continued he  smiling   they are paid for it  That is the key to a great deal of capacity  The public pays and must be served well  The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of  and the usual observations made   I have heard it asserted  said John Knightley   that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family  and where the same master teaches  it is natural enough  But for that reason  I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females  for boys have very little teaching after an early age  and scramble into any hand they can get  Isabella and Emma  I think  do write very much alike  I have not always known their writing apart   Yes  said his brother hesitatingly   there is a likeness  I know what you mean  but Emma  s hand is the strongest   Isabella and Emma both write beautifully  said Mr  Woodhouse   and always did  And so does poor Mrs  Weston  with half a sigh and half a smile at her   I never saw any gentleman  s handwriting  Emma began  looking also at Mrs  Weston  but stopped  on perceiving that Mrs  Weston was attending to some one else  and the pause gave her time to reflect   Now  how am I going to introduce him  Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people  Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase  Your Yorkshire friend  your correspondent in Yorkshire  that would be the way  I suppose  if I were very bad  No  I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress  I certainly get better and better  Now for it  Mrs  Weston was disengaged and Emma began again  Mr  Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman  s hands I ever saw   I do not admire it  said Mr  Knightley   It is too small  wants strength  It is like a woman  s writing  This was not submitted to by either lady  They vindicated him against the base aspersion   No  it by no means wanted strength  it was not a large hand  but very clear and certainly strong  Had not Mrs  Weston any letter about her to produce  No  she had heard from him very lately  but having answered the letter  had put it away   If we were in the other room  said Emma   if I had my writing  desk  I am sure I could produce a specimen  I have a note of his  Do not you remember  Mrs  Weston  employing him to write for you one day   He chose to say he was employed   Well  well  I have that note  and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr  Knightley   Oh  when a gallant young man  like Mr  Frank Churchill  said Mr  Knightley dryly   writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse  he will  of course  put forth his best  Dinner was on table  Mrs  Elton  before she could be spoken to  was ready  and before Mr  Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining  parlour  was saying   Must I go first  I really am ashamed of always leading the way  Jane  s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma  She had heard and seen it all  and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any  She suspected that it _had_  that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear  and that it had not been in vain  She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual  a glow both of complexion and spirits  She could have made an inquiry or two  as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails  it was at her tongue  s end  but she abstained  She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax  s feelings  and they followed the other ladies out of the room  arm in arm  with an appearance of good  will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each  CHAPTER XVII When the ladies returned to the drawing  room after dinner  Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties  with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs  Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself  She and Mrs  Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together  Mrs  Elton left them no choice  If Jane repressed her for a little time  she soon began again  and though much that passed between them was in a half  whisper  especially on Mrs  Elton  s side  there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects  The post  office  catching cold  fetching letters  and friendship  were long under discussion  and to them succeeded one  which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane  inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her  and professions of Mrs  Elton  s meditated activity   Here is April come  said she   I get quite anxious about you  June will soon be here   But I have never fixed on June or any other month  merely looked forward to the summer in general   But have you really heard of nothing   I have not even made any inquiry  I do not wish to make any yet   Oh  my dear  we cannot begin too early  you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing   I not aware  said Jane  shaking her head   dear Mrs  Elton  who can have thought of it as I have done   But you have not seen so much of the world as I have  You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations  I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove  A cousin of Mr  Suckling  Mrs  Bragge  had such an infinity of applications  every body was anxious to be in her family  for she moves in the first circle  Wax  candles in the schoolroom  You may imagine how desirable  Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs  Bragge  s is the one I would most wish to see you in   Colonel and Mrs  Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer  said Jane   I must spend some time with them  I am sure they will want it  afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself  But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present   Trouble  aye  I know your scruples  You are afraid of giving me trouble  but I assure you  my dear Jane  the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am  I shall write to Mrs  Partridge in a day or two  and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look  out for any thing eligible   Thank you  but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her  till the time draws nearer  I do not wish to be giving any body trouble   But  my dear child  the time is drawing near  here is April  and June  or say even July  is very near  with such business to accomplish before us  Your inexperience really amuses me  A situation such as you deserve  and your friends would require for you  is no everyday occurrence  is not obtained at a moment  s notice  indeed  indeed  we must begin inquiring directly   Excuse me  ma  am  but this is by no means my intention  I make no inquiry myself  and should be sorry to have any made by my friends  When I am quite determined as to the time  I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed  There are places in town  offices  where inquiry would soon produce something  Offices for the sale  not quite of human flesh  but of human intellect   Oh  my dear  human flesh  You quite shock me  if you mean a fling at the slave  trade  I assure you Mr  Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition   I did not mean  I was not thinking of the slave  trade  replied Jane   governess  trade  I assure you  was all that I had in view  widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on  but as to the greater misery of the victims  I do not know where it lies  But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices  and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do   Something that would do  repeated Mrs  Elton   Aye  _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself  I know what a modest creature you are  but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer  any inferior  commonplace situation  in a family not moving in a certain circle  or able to command the elegancies of life   You are very obliging  but as to all that  I am very indifferent  it would be no object to me to be with the rich  my mortifications  I think  would only be the greater  I should suffer more from comparison  A gentleman  s family is all that I should condition for   I know you  I know you  you would take up with any thing  but I shall be a little more nice  and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side  with your superior talents  you have a right to move in the first circle  Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms  have as many rooms as you like  and mix in the family as much as you chose  that is  I do not know  if you knew the harp  you might do all that  I am very sure  but you sing as well as play  yes  I really believe you might  even without the harp  stipulate for what you chose  and you must and shall be delightfully  honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest   You may well class the delight  the honour  and the comfort of such a situation together  said Jane   they are pretty sure to be equal  however  I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me  I am exceedingly obliged to you  Mrs  Elton  I am obliged to any body who feels for me  but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer  For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am  and as I am   And I am quite serious too  I assure you  replied Mrs  Elton gaily   in resolving to be always on the watch  and employing my friends to watch also  that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us  In this style she ran on  never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr  Woodhouse came into the room  her vanity had then a change of object  and Emma heard her saying in the same half  whisper to Jane   Here comes this dear old beau of mine  I protest  Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men  what a dear creature he is  I assure you I like him excessively  I admire all that quaint  old  fashioned politeness  it is much more to my taste than modern ease  modern ease often disgusts me  But this good old Mr  Woodhouse  I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner  Oh  I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous  I fancy I am rather a favourite  he took notice of my gown  How do you like it  Selina  s choice  handsome  I think  but I do not know whether it is not over  trimmed  I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over  trimmed  quite a horror of finery  I must put on a few ornaments now  because it is expected of me  A bride  you know  must appear like a bride  but my natural taste is all for simplicity  a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery  But I am quite in the minority  I believe  few people seem to value simplicity of dress  show and finery are every thing  I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin  Do you think it will look well  The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing  room when Mr  Weston made his appearance among them  He had returned to a late dinner  and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over  He had been too much expected by the best judges  for surprize  but there was great joy  Mr  Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now  as he would have been sorry to see him before  John Knightley only was in mute astonishment  That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London  should set off again  and walk half a mile to another man  s house  for the sake of being in mixed company till bed  time  of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers  was a circumstance to strike him deeply  A man who had been in motion since eight o  clock in the morning  and might now have been still  who had been long talking  and might have been silent  who had been in more than one crowd  and might have been alone  Such a man  to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside  and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world  Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife  there would have been a motive  but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party  John Knightley looked at him with amazement  then shrugged his shoulders  and said   I could not have believed it even of _him_  Mr  Weston meanwhile  perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting  happy and cheerful as usual  and with all the right of being principal talker  which a day spent anywhere from home confers  was making himself agreeable among the rest  and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner  convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten  and spread abroad what public news he had heard  was proceeding to a family communication  which  though principally addressed to Mrs  Weston  he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room  He gave her a letter  it was from Frank  and to herself  he had met with it in his way  and had taken the liberty of opening it   Read it  read it  said he   it will give you pleasure  only a few lines  will not take you long  read it to Emma  The two ladies looked over it together  and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time  in a voice a little subdued  but very audible to every body   Well  he is coming  you see  good news  I think  Well  what do you say to it  I always told you he would be here again soon  did not I  Anne  my dear  did not I always tell you so  and you would not believe me  In town next week  you see  at the latest  I dare say  for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done  most likely they will be there to  morrow or Saturday  As to her illness  all nothing of course  But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again  so near as town  They will stay a good while when they do come  and he will be half his time with us  This is precisely what I wanted  Well  pretty good news  is not it  Have you finished it  Has Emma read it all  Put it up  put it up  we will have a good talk about it some other time  but it will not do now  I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way  Mrs  Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion  Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them  She was happy  she knew she was happy  and knew she ought to be happy  Her congratulations were warm and open  but Emma could not speak so fluently  _She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings  and trying to understand the degree of her agitation  which she rather thought was considerable  Mr  Weston  however  too eager to be very observant  too communicative to want others to talk  was very well satisfied with what she did say  and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already  It was well that he took every body  s joy for granted  or he might not have thought either Mr  Woodhouse or Mr  Knightley particularly delighted  They were the first entitled  after Mrs  Weston and Emma  to be made happy  from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax  but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley  that it would have been too positive an interruption  and finding himself close to Mrs  Elton  and her attention disengaged  he necessarily began on the subject with her  CHAPTER XVIII  I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you  said Mr  Weston  Mrs  Elton  very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope  smiled most graciously   You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill  I presume  he continued   and know him to be my son  though he does not bear my name   Oh  yes  and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance  I am sure Mr  Elton will lose no time in calling on him  and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage   You are very obliging  Frank will be extremely happy  I am sure  He is to be in town next week  if not sooner  We have notice of it in a letter to  day  I met the letters in my way this morning  and seeing my son  s hand  presumed to open it  though it was not directed to me  it was to Mrs  Weston  She is his principal correspondent  I assure you  I hardly ever get a letter   And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her  Oh  Mr  Weston   laughing affectedly  I must protest against that  A most dangerous precedent indeed  I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example  Upon my word  if this is what I am to expect  we married women must begin to exert ourselves  Oh  Mr  Weston  I could not have believed it of you   Aye  we men are sad fellows  You must take care of yourself  Mrs  Elton  This letter tells us  it is a short letter  written in a hurry  merely to give us notice  it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly  on Mrs  Churchill  s account  she has not been well the whole winter  and thinks Enscombe too cold for her  so they are all to move southward without loss of time   Indeed  from Yorkshire  I think  Enscombe is in Yorkshire   Yes  they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London  a considerable journey   Yes  upon my word  very considerable  Sixty  five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London  But what is distance  Mr  Weston  to people of large fortune  You would be amazed to hear how my brother  Mr  Suckling  sometimes flies about  You will hardly believe me  but twice in one week he and Mr  Bragge went to London and back again with four horses   The evil of the distance from Enscombe  said Mr  Weston   is  that Mrs  Churchill  _as_ _we_ _understand_  has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together  In Frank  s last letter she complained  he said  of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle  s  This  you know  speaks a great degree of weakness  but now she is so impatient to be in town  that she means to sleep only two nights on the road  So Frank writes word  Certainly  delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions  Mrs  Elton  You must grant me that   No  indeed  I shall grant you nothing  I Always take the part of my own sex  I do indeed  I give you notice  You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point  I always stand up for women  and I assure you  if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn  you would not wonder at Mrs  Churchill  s making incredible exertions to avoid it  Selina says it is quite horror to her  and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety  She always travels with her own sheets  an excellent precaution  Does Mrs  Churchill do the same   Depend upon it  Mrs  Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did  Mrs  Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for  Mrs  Elton eagerly interposed with   Oh  Mr  Weston  do not mistake me  Selina is no fine lady  I assure you  Do not run away with such an idea   Is not she  Then she is no rule for Mrs  Churchill  who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld  Mrs  Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly  It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady  perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it  and she was considering in what way she had best retract  when Mr  Weston went on   Mrs  Churchill is not much in my good graces  as you may suspect  but this is quite between ourselves  She is very fond of Frank  and therefore I would not speak ill of her  Besides  she is out of health now  but _that_ indeed  by her own account  she has always been  I would not say so to every body  Mrs  Elton  but I have not much faith in Mrs  Churchill  s illness   If she is really ill  why not go to Bath  Mr  Weston  To Bath  or to Clifton   She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her  The fact is  I suppose  that she is tired of Enscombe  She has now been a longer time stationary there  than she ever was before  and she begins to want change  It is a retired place  A fine place  but very retired   Aye  like Maple Grove  I dare say  Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove  Such an immense plantation all round it  You seem shut out from every thing  in the most complete retirement  And Mrs  Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion  Or  perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life  I always say a woman cannot have too many resources  and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society   Frank was here in February for a fortnight   So I remember to have heard  He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again  that is  if I may presume to call myself an addition  But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world  This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by  and Mr  Weston  with a very good grace  immediately exclaimed   My dear madam  Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible  Not heard of you  I believe Mrs  Weston  s letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs  Elton  He had done his duty and could return to his son   When Frank left us  continued he   it was quite uncertain when we might see him again  which makes this day  s news doubly welcome  It has been completely unexpected  That is  _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon  I was sure something favourable would turn up  but nobody believed me  He and Mrs  Weston were both dreadfully desponding  ` How could he contrive to come  And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again  and so forth  I always felt that something would happen in our favour  and so it has  you see  I have observed  Mrs  Elton  in the course of my life  that if things are going untowardly one month  they are sure to mend the next   Very true  Mr  Weston  perfectly true  It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship  when  because things did not go quite right  did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings  he was apt to be in despair  and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen  s saffron robe would be put on for us  Oh  the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views  The carriage  we had disappointments about the carriage  one morning  I remember  he came to me quite in despair  She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing  and Mr  Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on   You were mentioning May  May is the very month which Mrs  Churchill is ordered  or has ordered herself  to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe  in short  to spend in London  so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring  precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it  days almost at the longest  weather genial and pleasant  always inviting one out  and never too hot for exercise  When he was here before  we made the best of it  but there was a good deal of wet  damp  cheerless weather  there always is in February  you know  and we could not do half that we intended  Now will be the time  This will be complete enjoyment  and I do not know  Mrs  Elton  whether the uncertainty of our meetings  the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to  day or to  morrow  and at any hour  may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house  I think it is so  I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight  I hope you will be pleased with my son  but you must not expect a prodigy  He is generally thought a fine young man  but do not expect a prodigy  Mrs  Weston  s partiality for him is very great  and  as you may suppose  most gratifying to me  She thinks nobody equal to him   And I assure you  Mr  Weston  I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour  I have heard so much in praise of Mr  Frank Churchill  At the same time it is fair to observe  that I am one of those who always judge for themselves  and are by no means implicitly guided by others  I give you notice that as I find your son  so I shall judge of him  I am no flatterer  Mr  Weston was musing   I hope  said he presently   I have not been severe upon poor Mrs  Churchill  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice  but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish  You cannot be ignorant  Mrs  Elton  of my connexion with the family  nor of the treatment I have met with  and  between ourselves  the whole blame of it is to be laid to her  She was the instigator  Frank  s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her  Mr  Churchill has pride  but his pride is nothing to his wife  s  his is a quiet  indolent  gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody  and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome  but her pride is arrogance and insolence  And what inclines one less to bear  she has no fair pretence of family or blood  She was nobody when he married her  barely the daughter of a gentleman  but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out  Churchill  d them all in high and mighty claims  but in herself  I assure you  she is an upstart   Only think  well  that must be infinitely provoking  I have quite a horror of upstarts  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort  for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves  Your description of Mrs  Churchill made me think of them directly  People of the name of Tupman  very lately settled there  and encumbered with many low connexions  but giving themselves immense airs  and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall  and how they got their fortune nobody knows  They came from Birmingham  which is not a place to promise much  you know  Mr  Weston  One has not great hopes from Birmingham  I always say there is something direful in the sound  but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans  though a good many things I assure you are suspected  and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother  Mr  Suckling  who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours  It is infinitely too bad  Mr  Suckling  who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove  and whose father had it before him  I believe  at least  I am almost sure that old Mr  Suckling had completed the purchase before his death  They were interrupted  Tea was carrying round  and Mr  Weston  having said all that he wanted  soon took the opportunity of walking away  After tea  Mr  and Mrs  Weston  and Mr  Elton sat down with Mr  Woodhouse to cards  The remaining five were left to their own powers  and Emma doubted their getting on very well  for Mr  Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation  Mrs  Elton was wanting notice  which nobody had inclination to pay  and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent  Mr  John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother  He was to leave them early the next day  and he soon began with   Well  Emma  I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys  but you have your sister  s letter  and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure  My charge would be much more concise than her  s  and probably not much in the same spirit  all that I have to recommend being comprised in  do not spoil them  and do not physic them   I rather hope to satisfy you both  said Emma   for I shall do all in my power to make them happy  which will be enough for Isabella  and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic   And if you find them troublesome  you must send them home again   That is very likely  You think so  do not you   I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father  or even may be some encumbrance to you  if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately   Increase   Certainly  you must be sensible that the last half  year has made a great difference in your way of life   Difference  No indeed I am not   There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be  Witness this very time  Here am I come down for only one day  and you are engaged with a dinner  party  When did it happen before  or any thing like it  Your neighbourhood is increasing  and you mix more with it  A little while ago  every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties  dinners at Mr  Cole  s  or balls at the Crown  The difference which Randalls  Randalls alone makes in your goings  on  is very great   Yes  said his brother quickly   it is Randalls that does it all   Very well  and as Randalls  I suppose  is not likely to have less influence than heretofore  it strikes me as a possible thing  Emma  that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way  And if they are  I only beg you to send them home   No  cried Mr  Knightley   that need not be the consequence  Let them be sent to Donwell  I shall certainly be at leisure   Upon my word  exclaimed Emma   you amuse me  I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party  and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys  These amazing engagements of mine  what have they been  Dining once with the Coles  and having a ball talked of  which never took place  I can understand you  nodding at Mr  John Knightley  your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here  delights you too much to pass unnoticed  But you   turning to Mr  Knightley  who know how very  very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield  why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me  I cannot imagine  And as to my dear little boys  I must say  that if Aunt Emma has not time for them  I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley  who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one  and who  when he is at home  is either reading to himself or settling his accounts  Mr  Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile  and succeeded without difficulty  upon Mrs  Elton  s beginning to talk to him  VOLUME III CHAPTER I A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill  She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed  it was for him  Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing  it was not worth thinking of  but if he  who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two  were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away  it would be very distressing  If a separation of two months should not have cooled him  there were dangers and evils before her  caution for him and for herself would be necessary  She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again  and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his  She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration  That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance  and yet  she could not help rather anticipating something decisive  She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis  an event  a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state  It was not very long  though rather longer than Mr  Weston had foreseen  before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill  s feelings  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined  but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards  He rode down for a couple of hours  he could not yet do more  but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield  she could then exercise all her quick observation  and speedily determine how he was influenced  and how she must act  They met with the utmost friendliness  There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her  But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done  of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree  She watched him well  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been  Absence  with the conviction probably of her indifference  had produced this very natural and very desirable effect  He was in high spirits  as ready to talk and laugh as ever  and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit  and recur to old stories  and he was not without agitation  It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference  He was not calm  his spirits were evidently fluttered  there was restlessness about him  Lively as he was  it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself  but what decided her belief on the subject  was his staying only a quarter of an hour  and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury   He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed  he had not stopped  he would not stop for more than a word  but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call  and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield  he must hurry off  She had no doubt as to his being less in love  but neither his agitated spirits  nor his hurrying away  seemed like a perfect cure  and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power  and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long  This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days  He was often hoping  intending to come  but was always prevented  His aunt could not bear to have him leave her  Such was his own account at Randall  s  If he were quite sincere  if he really tried to come  it was to be inferred that Mrs  Churchill  s removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder  That she was really ill was very certain  he had declared himself convinced of it  at Randalls  Though much might be fancy  he could not doubt  when he looked back  that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago  He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove  or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her  but he could not be prevailed on  by all his father  s doubts  to say that her complaints were merely imaginary  or that she was as strong as ever  It soon appeared that London was not the place for her  She could not endure its noise  Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering  and by the ten days  end  her nephew  s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan  They were going to remove immediately to Richmond  Mrs  Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there  and had otherwise a fancy for the place  A ready  furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged  and much benefit expected from the change  Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement  and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends  for the house was taken for May and June  She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them  almost as often as he could even wish  Emma saw how Mr  Weston understood these joyous prospects  He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered  She hoped it was not so  Two months must bring it to the proof  Mr  Weston  s own happiness was indisputable  He was quite delighted  It was the very circumstance he could have wished for  Now  it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood  What were nine miles to a young man  An hour  s ride  He would be always coming over  The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never  Sixteen miles  nay  eighteen  it must be full eighteen to Manchester  street  was a serious obstacle  Were he ever able to get away  the day would be spent in coming and returning  There was no comfort in having him in London  he might as well be at Enscombe  but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse  Better than nearer  One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal  the ball at the Crown  It had not been forgotten before  but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day  Now  however  it was absolutely to be  every preparation was resumed  and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond  a few lines from Frank  to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change  and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty  four hours at any given time  induced them to name as early a day as possible  Mr  Weston  s ball was to be a real thing  A very few to  morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness  Mr  Woodhouse was resigned  The time of year lightened the evil to him  May was better for every thing than February  Mrs  Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield  James had due notice  and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them  while dear Emma were gone  CHAPTER II No misfortune occurred  again to prevent the ball  The day approached  the day arrived  and after a morning of some anxious watching  Frank Churchill  in all the certainty of his own self  reached Randalls before dinner  and every thing was safe  No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma  The room at the Crown was to witness it  but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd  Mr  Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves  for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came  that she could not refuse him  and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man  s company  She was to convey Harriet  and they drove to the Crown in good time  the Randalls party just sufficiently before them  Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch  and though he did not say much  his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening  They all walked about together  to see that every thing was as it should be  and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage  which Emma could not hear the sound of at first  without great surprize   So unreasonably early  she was going to exclaim  but she presently found that it was a family of old friends  who were coming  like herself  by particular desire  to help Mr  Weston  s judgment  and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins  who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness  on the same errand  that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection  Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr  Weston depended  and felt  that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes  was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity  She liked his open manners  but a little less of open  heartedness would have made him a higher character  General benevolence  but not general friendship  made a man what he ought to be  She could fancy such a man  The whole party walked about  and looked  and praised again  and then  having nothing else to do  formed a sort of half  circle round the fire  to observe in their various modes  till other subjects were started  that  though _May_  a fire in the evening was still very pleasant  Emma found that it was not Mr  Weston  s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger  They had stopped at Mrs  Bates  s door to offer the use of their carriage  but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons  Frank was standing by her  but not steadily  there was a restlessness  which shewed a mind not at ease  He was looking about  he was going to the door  he was watching for the sound of other carriages  impatient to begin  or afraid of being always near her  Mrs  Elton was spoken of   I think she must be here soon  said he   I have a great curiosity to see Mrs  Elton  I have heard so much of her  It cannot be long  I think  before she comes  A carriage was heard  He was on the move immediately  but coming back  said   I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her  I have never seen either Mr  or Mrs  Elton  I have no business to put myself forward  Mr  and Mrs  Elton appeared  and all the smiles and the proprieties passed   But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax  said Mr  Weston  looking about   We thought you were to bring them  The mistake had been slight  The carriage was sent for them now  Emma longed to know what Frank  s first opinion of Mrs  Elton might be  how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress  and her smiles of graciousness  He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion  by giving her very proper attention  after the introduction had passed  In a few minutes the carriage returned  Somebody talked of rain   I will see that there are umbrellas  sir  said Frank to his father   Miss Bates must not be forgotten  and away he went  Mr  Weston was following  but Mrs  Elton detained him  to gratify him by her opinion of his son  and so briskly did she begin  that the young man himself  though by no means moving slowly  could hardly be out of hearing   A very fine young man indeed  Mr  Weston  You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion  and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him  You may believe me  I never compliment  I think him a very handsome young man  and his manners are precisely what I like and approve  so truly the gentleman  without the least conceit or puppyism  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies  quite a horror of them  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove  Neither Mr  Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them  and we used sometimes to say very cutting things  Selina  who is mild almost to a fault  bore with them much better  While she talked of his son  Mr  Weston  s attention was chained  but when she got to Maple Grove  he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to  and with happy smiles must hurry away  Mrs  Elton turned to Mrs  Weston   I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane  Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious  I believe we drive faster than any body  What a pleasure it is to send one  s carriage for a friend  I understand you were so kind as to offer  but another time it will be quite unnecessary  You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_  Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax  escorted by the two gentlemen  walked into the room  and Mrs  Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs  Weston  s to receive them  Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma  but her words  every body  s words  were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates  who came in talking  and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire  As the door opened she was heard   So very obliging of you  No rain at all  Nothing to signify  I do not care for myself  Quite thick shoes  And Jane declares  Well  as soon as she was within the door  Well  This is brilliant indeed  This is admirable  Excellently contrived  upon my word  Nothing wanting  Could not have imagined it  So well lighted up  Jane  Jane  look  did you ever see any thing  Oh  Mr  Weston  you must really have had Aladdin  s lamp  Good Mrs  Stokes would not know her own room again  I saw her as I came in  she was standing in the entrance  ` Oh  Mrs  Stokes  said I  but I had not time for more  She was now met by Mrs  Weston   Very well  I thank you  ma  am  I hope you are quite well  Very happy to hear it  So afraid you might have a headache  seeing you pass by so often  and knowing how much trouble you must have  Delighted to hear it indeed  Ah  dear Mrs  Elton  so obliged to you for the carriage  excellent time  Jane and I quite ready  Did not keep the horses a moment  Most comfortable carriage  Oh  and I am sure our thanks are due to you  Mrs  Weston  on that score  Mrs  Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note  or we should have been  But two such offers in one day  Never were such neighbours  I said to my mother  ` Upon my word  ma  am  Thank you  my mother is remarkably well  Gone to Mr  Woodhouse  s  I made her take her shawl  for the evenings are not warm  her large new shawl  Mrs  Dixon  s wedding  present  So kind of her to think of my mother  Bought at Weymouth  you know  Mr  Dixon  s choice  There were three others  Jane says  which they hesitated about some time  Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive  My dear Jane  are you sure you did not wet your feet  It was but a drop or two  but I am so afraid  but Mr  Frank Churchill was so extremely  and there was a mat to step upon  I shall never forget his extreme politeness  Oh  Mr  Frank Churchill  I must tell you my mother  s spectacles have never been in fault since  the rivet never came out again  My mother often talks of your good  nature  Does not she  Jane  Do not we often talk of Mr  Frank Churchill  Ah  here  s Miss Woodhouse  Dear Miss Woodhouse  how do you do  Very well I thank you  quite well  This is meeting quite in fairy  land  Such a transformation  Must not compliment  I know  eyeing Emma most complacently  that would be rude  but upon my word  Miss Woodhouse  you do look  how do you like Jane  s hair  You are a judge  She did it all herself  Quite wonderful how she does her hair  No hairdresser from London I think could  Ah  Dr  Hughes I declare  and Mrs  Hughes  Must go and speak to Dr  and Mrs  Hughes for a moment  How do you do  How do you do  Very well  I thank you  This is delightful  is not it  Where  s dear Mr  Richard  Oh  there he is  Don  t disturb him  Much better employed talking to the young ladies  How do you do  Mr  Richard  I saw you the other day as you rode through the town  Mrs  Otway  I protest  and good Mr  Otway  and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline  Such a host of friends  and Mr  George and Mr  Arthur  How do you do  How do you all do  Quite well  I am much obliged to you  Never better  Don  t I hear another carriage  Who can this be  very likely the worthy Coles  Upon my word  this is charming to be standing about among such friends  And such a noble fire  I am quite roasted  No coffee  I thank you  for me  never take coffee  A little tea if you please  sir  by and bye  no hurry  Oh  here it comes  Every thing so good  Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma  and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet  she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs  Elton and Miss Fairfax  who were standing a little way behind her  He was thoughtful  Whether he were overhearing too  she could not determine  After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look  compliments very quietly and properly taken  Mrs  Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself  and it was   How do you like my gown  How do you like my trimming  How has Wright done my hair  with many other relative questions  all answered with patient politeness  Mrs  Elton then said   Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do  but upon such an occasion as this  when every body  s eyes are so much upon me  and in compliment to the Westons  who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour  I would not wish to be inferior to others  And I see very few pearls in the room except mine  So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer  I understand  We shall see if our styles suit  A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill  I like him very well  At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously  that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises  and did not want to hear more  and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while  till another suspension brought Mrs  Elton  s tones again distinctly forward  Mr  Elton had just joined them  and his wife was exclaiming   Oh  you have found us out at last  have you  in our seclusion  I was this moment telling Jane  I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us   Jane  repeated Frank Churchill  with a look of surprize and displeasure   That is easy  but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it  I suppose   How do you like Mrs  Elton  said Emma in a whisper   Not at all   You are ungrateful   Ungrateful  What do you mean  Then changing from a frown to a smile  No  do not tell me  I do not want to know what you mean  Where is my father  When are we to begin dancing  Emma could hardly understand him  he seemed in an odd humour  He walked off to find his father  but was quickly back again with both Mr  and Mrs  Weston  He had met with them in a little perplexity  which must be laid before Emma  It had just occurred to Mrs  Weston that Mrs  Elton must be asked to begin the ball  that she would expect it  which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction  Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude   And what are we to do for a proper partner for her  said Mr  Weston   She will think Frank ought to ask her  Frank turned instantly to Emma  to claim her former promise  and boasted himself an engaged man  which his father looked his most perfect approbation of  and it then appeared that Mrs  Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs  Elton himself  and that their business was to help to persuade him into it  which was done pretty soon  Mr  Weston and Mrs  Elton led the way  Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs  Elton  though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her  It was almost enough to make her think of marrying  Mrs  Elton had undoubtedly the advantage  at this time  in vanity completely gratified  for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill  she could not lose by the change  Mr  Weston might be his son  s superior  In spite of this little rub  however  Emma was smiling with enjoyment  delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming  and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her  She was more disturbed by Mr  Knightley  s not dancing than by any thing else  There he was  among the standers  by  where he ought not to be  he ought to be dancing  not classing himself with the husbands  and fathers  and whist  players  who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up  so young as he looked  He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere  than where he had placed himself  His tall  firm  upright figure  among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men  was such as Emma felt must draw every body  s eyes  and  excepting her own partner  there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him  He moved a few steps nearer  and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner  with what natural grace  he must have danced  would he but take the trouble  Whenever she caught his eye  she forced him to smile  but in general he was looking grave  She wished he could love a ballroom better  and could like Frank Churchill better  He seemed often observing her  She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing  but if he were criticising her behaviour  she did not feel afraid  There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner  They seemed more like cheerful  easy friends  than lovers  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done  was indubitable  The ball proceeded pleasantly  The anxious cares  the incessant attentions of Mrs  Weston  were not thrown away  Every body seemed happy  and the praise of being a delightful ball  which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be  was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this  Of very important  very recordable events  it was not more productive than such meetings usually are  There was one  however  which Emma thought something of  The two last dances before supper were begun  and Harriet had no partner  the only young lady sitting down  and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers  that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder  But Emma  s wonder lessened soon afterwards  on seeing Mr  Elton sauntering about  He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided  she was sure he would not  and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card  room  Escape  however  was not his plan  He came to the part of the room where the sitters  by were collected  spoke to some  and walked about in front of them  as if to shew his liberty  and his resolution of maintaining it  He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith  or speaking to those who were close to her  Emma saw it  She was not yet dancing  she was working her way up from the bottom  and had therefore leisure to look around  and by only turning her head a little she saw it all  When she was half  way up the set  the whole group were exactly behind her  and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch  but Mr  Elton was so near  that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs  Weston  and she perceived that his wife  who was standing immediately above her  was not only listening also  but even encouraging him by significant glances  The kind  hearted  gentle Mrs  Weston had left her seat to join him and say   Do not you dance  Mr  Elton  to which his prompt reply was   Most readily  Mrs  Weston  if you will dance with me   Me  oh  no  I would get you a better partner than myself  I am no dancer   If Mrs  Gilbert wishes to dance  said he   I shall have great pleasure  I am sure  for  though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man  and that my dancing days are over  it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs  Gilbert   Mrs  Gilbert does not mean to dance  but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing  Miss Smith   Miss Smith  oh  I had not observed  You are extremely obliging  and if I were not an old married man  But my dancing days are over  Mrs  Weston  You will excuse me  Any thing else I should be most happy to do  at your command  but my dancing days are over  Mrs  Weston said no more  and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat  This was Mr  Elton  the amiable  obliging  gentle Mr  Elton  She looked round for a moment  he had joined Mr  Knightley at a little distance  and was arranging himself for settled conversation  while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife  She would not look again  Her heart was in a glow  and she feared her face might be as hot  In another moment a happier sight caught her  Mr  Knightley leading Harriet to the set  Never had she been more surprized  seldom more delighted  than at that instant  She was all pleasure and gratitude  both for Harriet and herself  and longed to be thanking him  and though too distant for speech  her countenance said much  as soon as she could catch his eye again  His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it  extremely good  and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky  if it had not been for the cruel state of things before  and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced  It was not thrown away on her  she bounded higher than ever  flew farther down the middle  and was in a continual course of smiles  Mr  Elton had retreated into the card  room  looking  Emma trusted  very foolish  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife  though growing very like her  _she_ spoke some of her feelings  by observing audibly to her partner   Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith  Very goodnatured  I declare  Supper was announced  The move began  and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment  without interruption  till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon   Jane  Jane  my dear Jane  where are you  Here is your tippet  Mrs  Weston begs you to put on your tippet  She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage  though every thing has been done  One door nailed up  Quantities of matting  My dear Jane  indeed you must  Mr  Churchill  oh  you are too obliging  How well you put it on  so gratified  Excellent dancing indeed  Yes  my dear  I ran home  as I said I should  to help grandmama to bed  and got back again  and nobody missed me  I set off without saying a word  just as I told you  Grandmama was quite well  had a charming evening with Mr  Woodhouse  a vast deal of chat  and backgammon  Tea was made downstairs  biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away  amazing luck in some of her throws  and she inquired a great deal about you  how you were amused  and who were your partners  ` Oh  said I  ` I shall not forestall Jane  I left her dancing with Mr  George Otway  she will love to tell you all about it herself to  morrow  her first partner was Mr  Elton  I do not know who will ask her next  perhaps Mr  William Cox  My dear sir  you are too obliging  Is there nobody you would not rather  I am not helpless  Sir  you are most kind  Upon my word  Jane on one arm  and me on the other  Stop  stop  let us stand a little back  Mrs  Elton is going  dear Mrs  Elton  how elegant she looks  Beautiful lace  Now we all follow in her train  Quite the queen of the evening  Well  here we are at the passage  Two steps  Jane  take care of the two steps  Oh  no  there is but one  Well  I was persuaded there were two  How very odd  I was convinced there were two  and there is but one  I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style  Candles everywhere  I was telling you of your grandmama  Jane  There was a little disappointment  The baked apples and biscuits  excellent in their way  you know  but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first  and good Mr  Woodhouse  not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough  sent it all out again  Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus  so she was rather disappointed  but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body  for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse  who would be so very much concerned  Well  this is brilliant  I am all amazement  could not have supposed any thing  Such elegance and profusion  I have seen nothing like it since  Well  where shall we sit  where shall we sit  Anywhere  so that Jane is not in a draught  Where _I_ sit is of no consequence  Oh  do you recommend this side  Well  I am sure  Mr  Churchill  only it seems too good  but just as you please  What you direct in this house cannot be wrong  Dear Jane  how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama  Soup too  Bless me  I should not be helped so soon  but it smells most excellent  and I cannot help beginning  Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr  Knightley till after supper  but  when they were all in the ballroom again  her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked  He was warm in his reprobation of Mr  Elton  s conduct  it had been unpardonable rudeness  and Mrs  Elton  s looks also received the due share of censure   They aimed at wounding more than Harriet  said he   Emma  why is it that they are your enemies  He looked with smiling penetration  and  on receiving no answer  added   _She_ ought not to be angry with you  I suspect  whatever he may be  To that surmise  you say nothing  of course  but confess  Emma  that you did want him to marry Harriet   I did  replied Emma   and they cannot forgive me  He shook his head  but there was a smile of indulgence with it  and he only said   I shall not scold you  I leave you to your own reflections   Can you trust me with such flatterers  Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong   Not your vain spirit  but your serious spirit  If one leads you wrong  I am sure the other tells you of it   I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr  Elton  There is a littleness about him which you discovered  and which I did not  and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet  It was through a series of strange blunders   And  in return for your acknowledging so much  I will do you the justice to say  that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself  Harriet Smith has some first  rate qualities  which Mrs  Elton is totally without  An unpretending  single  minded  artless girl  infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs  Elton  I found Harriet more conversable than I expected  Emma was extremely gratified  They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr  Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again   Come Miss Woodhouse  Miss Otway  Miss Fairfax  what are you all doing  Come Emma  set your companions the example  Every body is lazy  Every body is asleep   I am ready  said Emma   whenever I am wanted   Whom are you going to dance with  asked Mr  Knightley  She hesitated a moment  and then replied   With you  if you will ask me   Will you  said he  offering his hand   Indeed I will  You have shewn that you can dance  and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper   Brother and sister  no  indeed  CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr  Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball  which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy  She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons  and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike  and his praise of Harriet  his concession in her favour  was peculiarly gratifying  The impertinence of the Eltons  which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening  had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions  and she looked forward to another happy result  the cure of Harriet  s infatuation  From Harriet  s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom  she had strong hopes  It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened  and she were enabled to see that Mr  Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him  The fever was over  and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy  She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite  Harriet rational  Frank Churchill not too much in love  and Mr  Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her  how very happy a summer must be before her  She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning  He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield  as he was to be at home by the middle of the day  She did not regret it  Having arranged all these matters  looked them through  and put them all to rights  she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys  as well as of their grandpapa  when the great iron sweep  gate opened  and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together  Frank Churchill  with Harriet leaning on his arm  actually Harriet  A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened  Harriet looked white and frightened  and he was trying to cheer her  The iron gates and the front  door were not twenty yards asunder  they were all three soon in the hall  and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away  A young lady who faints  must be recovered  questions must be answered  and surprizes be explained  Such events are very interesting  but the suspense of them cannot last long  A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole  Miss Smith  and Miss Bickerton  another parlour boarder at Mrs  Goddard  s  who had been also at the ball  had walked out together  and taken a road  the Richmond road  which  though apparently public enough for safety  had led them into alarm  About half a mile beyond Highbury  making a sudden turn  and deeply shaded by elms on each side  it became for a considerable stretch very retired  and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it  they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them  on a broader patch of greensward by the side  a party of gipsies  A child on the watch  came towards them to beg  and Miss Bickerton  excessively frightened  gave a great scream  and calling on Harriet to follow her  ran up a steep bank  cleared a slight hedge at the top  and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury  But poor Harriet could not follow  She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing  and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless  and in this state  and exceedingly terrified  she had been obliged to remain  How the trampers might have behaved  had the young ladies been more courageous  must be doubtful  but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted  and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children  headed by a stout woman and a great boy  all clamorous  and impertinent in look  though not absolutely in word  More and more frightened  she immediately promised them money  and taking out her purse  gave them a shilling  and begged them not to want more  or to use her ill  She was then able to walk  though but slowly  and was moving away  but her terror and her purse were too tempting  and she was followed  or rather surrounded  by the whole gang  demanding more  In this state Frank Churchill had found her  she trembling and conditioning  they loud and insolent  By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment  The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward  and leave his horses to meet him by another road  a mile or two beyond Highbury  and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates  and to have forgotten to restore them  he had been obliged to stop at her door  and go in for a few minutes  he was therefore later than he had intended  and being on foot  was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them  The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion  He had left them completely frightened  and Harriet eagerly clinging to him  and hardly able to speak  had just strength enough to reach Hartfield  before her spirits were quite overcome  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield  he had thought of no other place  This was the amount of the whole story  of his communication and of Harriet  s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech  He dared not stay longer than to see her well  these several delays left him not another minute to lose  and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs  Goddard  and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr  Knightley  he set off  with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself  Such an adventure as this  a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way  could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain  So Emma thought  at least  Could a linguist  could a grammarian  could even a mathematician have seen what she did  have witnessed their appearance together  and heard their history of it  without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other  How much more must an imaginist  like herself  be on fire with speculation and foresight  especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made  It was a very extraordinary thing  Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place  within her memory  no rencontre  no alarm of the kind  and now it had happened to the very person  and at the very hour  when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her  It certainly was very extraordinary  And knowing  as she did  the favourable state of mind of each at this period  it struck her the more  He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself  she just recovering from her mania for Mr  Elton  It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences  It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other  In the few minutes  conversation which she had yet had with him  while Harriet had been partially insensible  he had spoken of her terror  her naivete  her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm  with a sensibility amused and delighted  and just at last  after Harriet  s own account had been given  he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms  Every thing was to take its natural course  however  neither impelled nor assisted  She would not stir a step  nor drop a hint  No  she had had enough of interference  There could be no harm in a scheme  a mere passive scheme  It was no more than a wish  Beyond it she would on no account proceed  Emma  s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed  aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion  but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible  Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury  It was the very event to engage those who talk most  the young and the low  and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news  The last night  s ball seemed lost in the gipsies  Poor Mr  Woodhouse trembled as he sat  and  as Emma had foreseen  would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again  It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse  for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after  as well as Miss Smith  were coming in during the rest of the day  and he had the pleasure of returning for answer  that they were all very indifferent  which  though not exactly true  for she was perfectly well  and Harriet not much otherwise  Emma would not interfere with  She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man  for she hardly knew what indisposition was  and if he did not invent illnesses for her  she could make no figure in a message  The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice  they took themselves off in a hurry  The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began  and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews  in her imagination it maintained its ground  and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies  and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital  CHAPTER IV A very few days had passed after this adventure  when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand  and after sitting down and hesitating  thus began   Miss Woodhouse  if you are at leisure  I have something that I should like to tell you  a sort of confession to make  and then  you know  it will be over  Emma was a good deal surprized  but begged her to speak  There was a seriousness in Harriet  s manner which prepared her  quite as much as her words  for something more than ordinary   It is my duty  and I am sure it is my wish  she continued   to have no reserves with you on this subject  As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_  it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it  I do not want to say more than is necessary  I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done  and I dare say you understand me   Yes  said Emma   I hope I do   How I could so long a time be fancying myself     cried Harriet  warmly   It seems like madness  I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now  I do not care whether I meet him or not  except that of the two I had rather not see him  and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him  but I do not envy his wife in the least  I neither admire her nor envy her  as I have done  she is very charming  I dare say  and all that  but I think her very ill  tempered and disagreeable  I shall never forget her look the other night  However  I assure you  Miss Woodhouse  I wish her no evil  No  let them be ever so happy together  it will not give me another moment  s pang  and to convince you that I have been speaking truth  I am now going to destroy  what I ought to have destroyed long ago  what I ought never to have kept  I know that very well  blushing as she spoke  However  now I will destroy it all  and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence  that you may see how rational I am grown  Cannot you guess what this parcel holds  said she  with a conscious look   Not the least in the world  Did he ever give you any thing   No  I cannot call them gifts  but they are things that I have valued very much  She held the parcel towards her  and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top  Her curiosity was greatly excited  Harriet unfolded the parcel  and she looked on with impatience  Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge  ware box  which Harriet opened  it was well lined with the softest cotton  but  excepting the cotton  Emma saw only a small piece of court  plaister   Now  said Harriet   you _must_ recollect   No  indeed I do not   Dear me  I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court  plaister  one of the very last times we ever met in it  It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat  just before Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley came  I think the very evening  Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife  and your recommending court  plaister  But  as you had none about you  and knew I had  you desired me to supply him  and so I took mine out and cut him a piece  but it was a great deal too large  and he cut it smaller  and kept playing some time with what was left  before he gave it back to me  And so then  in my nonsense  I could not help making a treasure of it  so I put it by never to be used  and looked at it now and then as a great treat   My dearest Harriet  cried Emma  putting her hand before her face  and jumping up   you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear  Remember it  Aye  I remember it all now  all  except your saving this relic  I knew nothing of that till this moment  but the cutting the finger  and my recommending court  plaister  and saying I had none about me  Oh  my sins  my sins  And I had plenty all the while in my pocket  One of my senseless tricks  I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life  Well  sitting down again  go on  what else   And had you really some at hand yourself  I am sure I never suspected it  you did it so naturally   And so you actually put this piece of court  plaister by for his sake  said Emma  recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement  And secretly she added to herself   Lord bless me  when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court  plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about  I never was equal to this   Here  resumed Harriet  turning to her box again   here is something still more valuable  I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable  because this is what did really once belong to him  which the court  plaister never did  Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure  It was the end of an old pencil  the part without any lead   This was really his  said Harriet  Do not you remember one morning  no  I dare say you do not  But one morning  I forget exactly the day  but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_ _evening_  he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket  book  it was about spruce  beer  Mr  Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce  beer  and he wanted to put it down  but when he took out his pencil  there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away  and it would not do  so you lent him another  and this was left upon the table as good for nothing  But I kept my eye on it  and  as soon as I dared  caught it up  and never parted with it again from that moment   I do remember it  cried Emma   I perfectly remember it  Talking about spruce  beer  Oh  yes  Mr  Knightley and I both saying we liked it  and Mr  Elton  s seeming resolved to learn to like it too  I perfectly remember it  Stop  Mr  Knightley was standing just here  was not he  I have an idea he was standing just here   Ah  I do not know  I cannot recollect  It is very odd  but I cannot recollect  Mr  Elton was sitting here  I remember  much about where I am now   Well  go on   Oh  that  s all  I have nothing more to shew you  or to say  except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire  and I wish you to see me do it   My poor dear Harriet  and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things   Yes  simpleton as I was  but I am quite ashamed of it now  and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them  It was very wrong of me  you know  to keep any remembrances  after he was married  I knew it was  but had not resolution enough to part with them   But  Harriet  is it necessary to burn the court  plaister  I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil  but the court  plaister might be useful   I shall be happier to burn it  replied Harriet   It has a disagreeable look to me  I must get rid of every thing  There it goes  and there is an end  thank Heaven  of Mr  Elton   And when  thought Emma   will there be a beginning of Mr  Churchill  She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made  and could not but hope that the gipsy  though she had _told_ no fortune  might be proved to have made Harriet  s  About a fortnight after the alarm  they came to a sufficient explanation  and quite undesignedly  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment  which made the information she received more valuable  She merely said  in the course of some trivial chat   Well  Harriet  whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so  and thought no more of it  till after a minute  s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone   I shall never marry  Emma then looked up  and immediately saw how it was  and after a moment  s debate  as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not  replied   Never marry  This is a new resolution   It is one that I shall never change  however  After another short hesitation   I hope it does not proceed from  I hope it is not in compliment to Mr  Elton   Mr  Elton indeed  cried Harriet indignantly  Oh  no  and Emma could just catch the words   so superior to Mr  Elton  She then took a longer time for consideration  Should she proceed no farther  should she let it pass  and seem to suspect nothing  Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did  or perhaps if she were totally silent  it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much  and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been  such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances  she was perfectly resolved  She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once  all that she meant to say and know  Plain dealing was always best  She had previously determined how far she would proceed  on any application of the sort  and it would be safer for both  to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed  She was decided  and thus spoke   Harriet  I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning  Your resolution  or rather your expectation of never marrying  results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer  would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you  Is not it so   Oh  Miss Woodhouse  believe me I have not the presumption to suppose  Indeed I am not so mad  But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance  and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world  with the gratitude  wonder  and veneration  which are so proper  in me especially   I am not at all surprized at you  Harriet  The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart   Service  oh  it was such an inexpressible obligation  The very recollection of it  and all that I felt at the time  when I saw him coming  his noble look  and my wretchedness before  Such a change  In one moment such a change  From perfect misery to perfect happiness   It is very natural  It is natural  and it is honourable  Yes  honourable  I think  to chuse so well and so gratefully  But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise  I do not advise you to give way to it  Harriet  I do not by any means engage for its being returned  Consider what you are about  Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can  at any rate do not let them carry you far  unless you are persuaded of his liking you  Be observant of him  Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations  I give you this caution now  because I shall never speak to you again on the subject  I am determined against all interference  Henceforward I know nothing of the matter  Let no name ever pass our lips  We were very wrong before  we will be cautious now  He is your superior  no doubt  and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature  but yet  Harriet  more wonderful things have taken place  there have been matches of greater disparity  But take care of yourself  I would not have you too sanguine  though  however it may end  be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_  is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value  Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude  Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind  and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation  CHAPTER V In this state of schemes  and hopes  and connivance  June opened upon Hartfield  To Highbury in general it brought no material change  The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings  and of the use to be made of their barouche  landau  and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother  s  and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed  and August  instead of Midsummer  fixed for it  she was likely to remain there full two months longer  provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs  Elton  s activity in her service  and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will  Mr  Knightley  who  for some reason best known to himself  had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill  was only growing to dislike him more  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable  Every thing declared it  his own attentions  his father  s hints  his mother  in  law  s guarded silence  it was all in unison  words  conduct  discretion  and indiscretion  told the same story  But while so many were devoting him to Emma  and Emma herself making him over to Harriet  Mr  Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax  He could not understand it  but there were symptoms of intelligence between them  he thought so at least  symptoms of admiration on his side  which  having once observed  he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning  however he might wish to escape any of Emma  s errors of imagination  _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose  He was dining with the Randalls family  and Jane  at the Eltons  and he had seen a look  more than a single look  at Miss Fairfax  which  from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse  seemed somewhat out of place  When he was again in their company  he could not help remembering what he had seen  nor could he avoid observations which  unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight   Myself creating what I saw  brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking  of private understanding even  between Frank Churchill and Jane  He had walked up one day after dinner  as he very often did  to spend his evening at Hartfield  Emma and Harriet were going to walk  he joined them  and  on returning  they fell in with a larger party  who  like themselves  judged it wisest to take their exercise early  as the weather threatened rain  Mr  and Mrs  Weston and their son  Miss Bates and her niece  who had accidentally met  They all united  and  on reaching Hartfield gates  Emma  who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father  pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him  The Randalls party agreed to it immediately  and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates  which few persons listened to  she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse  s most obliging invitation  As they were turning into the grounds  Mr  Perry passed by on horseback  The gentlemen spoke of his horse   By the bye  said Frank Churchill to Mrs  Weston presently   what became of Mr  Perry  s plan of setting up his carriage  Mrs  Weston looked surprized  and said   I did not know that he ever had any such plan   Nay  I had it from you  You wrote me word of it three months ago   Me  impossible   Indeed you did  I remember it perfectly  You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon  Mrs  Perry had told somebody  and was extremely happy about it  It was owing to _her_ persuasion  as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm  You must remember it now   Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment   Never  really  never  Bless me  how could it be  Then I must have dreamt it  but I was completely persuaded  Miss Smith  you walk as if you were tired  You will not be sorry to find yourself at home   What is this  What is this  cried Mr  Weston   about Perry and a carriage  Is Perry going to set up his carriage  Frank  I am glad he can afford it  You had it from himself  had you   No  sir  replied his son  laughing   I seem to have had it from nobody  Very odd  I really was persuaded of Mrs  Weston  s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe  many weeks ago  with all these particulars  but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before  of course it must have been a dream  I am a great dreamer  I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away  and when I have gone through my particular friends  then I begin dreaming of Mr  and Mrs  Perry   It is odd though  observed his father   that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe  Perry  s setting up his carriage  and his wife  s persuading him to it  out of care for his health  just what will happen  I have no doubt  some time or other  only a little premature  What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream  And at others  what a heap of absurdities it is  Well  Frank  your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent  Emma  you are a great dreamer  I think  Emma was out of hearing  She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance  and was beyond the reach of Mr  Weston  s hint   Why  to own the truth  cried Miss Bates  who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes   if I must speak on this subject  there is no denying that Mr  Frank Churchill might have  I do not mean to say that he did not dream it  I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world  but if I am questioned about it  I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring  for Mrs  Perry herself mentioned it to my mother  and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves  but it was quite a secret  known to nobody else  and only thought of about three days  Mrs  Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage  and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed  Jane  don  t you remember grandmama  s telling us of it when we got home  I forget where we had been walking to  very likely to Randalls  yes  I think it was to Randalls  Mrs  Perry was always particularly fond of my mother  indeed I do not know who is not  and she had mentioned it to her in confidence  she had no objection to her telling us  of course  but it was not to go beyond  and  from that day to this  I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of  At the same time  I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint  because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware  I am a talker  you know  I am rather a talker  and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not  I am not like Jane  I wish I were  I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world  Where is she  Oh  just behind  Perfectly remember Mrs  Perry  s coming  Extraordinary dream  indeed  They were entering the hall  Mr  Knightley  s eyes had preceded Miss Bates  s in a glance at Jane  From Frank Churchill  s face  where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away  he had involuntarily turned to hers  but she was indeed behind  and too busy with her shawl  Mr  Weston had walked in  The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass  Mr  Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye  he seemed watching her intently  in vain  however  if it were so  Jane passed between them into the hall  and looked at neither  There was no time for farther remark or explanation  The dream must be borne with  and Mr  Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield  and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use  instead of the small  sized Pembroke  on which two of his daily meals had  for forty years been crowded  Tea passed pleasantly  and nobody seemed in a hurry to move   Miss Woodhouse  said Frank Churchill  after examining a table behind him  which he could reach as he sat   have your nephews taken away their alphabets  their box of letters  It used to stand here  Where is it  This is a sort of dull  looking evening  that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer  We had great amusement with those letters one morning  I want to puzzle you again  Emma was pleased with the thought  and producing the box  the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets  which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves  They were rapidly forming words for each other  or for any body else who would be puzzled  The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr  Woodhouse  who had often been distressed by the more animated sort  which Mr  Weston had occasionally introduced  and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting  with tender melancholy  over the departure of the  poor little boys  or in fondly pointing out  as he took up any stray letter near him  how beautifully Emma had written it  Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax  She gave a slight glance round the table  and applied herself to it  Frank was next to Emma  Jane opposite to them  and Mr  Knightley so placed as to see them all  and it was his object to see as much as he could  with as little apparent observation  The word was discovered  and with a faint smile pushed away  If meant to be immediately mixed with the others  and buried from sight  she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across  for it was not mixed  and Harriet  eager after every fresh word  and finding out none  directly took it up  and fell to work  She was sitting by Mr  Knightley  and turned to him for help  The word was _blunder_  and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it  there was a blush on Jane  s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible  Mr  Knightley connected it with the dream  but how it could all be  was beyond his comprehension  How the delicacy  the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep  He feared there must be some decided involvement  Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn  These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick  It was a child  s play  chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill  s part  With great indignation did he continue to observe him  with great alarm and distrust  to observe also his two blinded companions  He saw a short word prepared for Emma  and given to her with a look sly and demure  He saw that Emma had soon made it out  and found it highly entertaining  though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure  for she said   Nonsense  for shame  He heard Frank Churchill next say  with a glance towards Jane   I will give it to her  shall I  and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth   No  no  you must not  you shall not  indeed  It was done however  This gallant young man  who seemed to love without feeling  and to recommend himself without complaisance  directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax  and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it  Mr  Knightley  s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be  made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it  and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_  Jane Fairfax  s perception seemed to accompany his  her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning  the superior intelligence  of those five letters so arranged  She was evidently displeased  looked up  and seeing herself watched  blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her  and saying only   I did not know that proper names were allowed  pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit  and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered  Her face was averted from those who had made the attack  and turned towards her aunt   Aye  very true  my dear  cried the latter  though Jane had not spoken a word  I was just going to say the same thing  It is time for us to be going indeed  The evening is closing in  and grandmama will be looking for us  My dear sir  you are too obliging  We really must wish you good night  Jane  s alertness in moving  proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived  She was immediately up  and wanting to quit the table  but so many were also moving  that she could not get away  and Mr  Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her  and resolutely swept away by her unexamined  She was afterwards looking for her shawl  Frank Churchill was looking also  it was growing dusk  and the room was in confusion  and how they parted  Mr  Knightley could not tell  He remained at Hartfield after all the rest  his thoughts full of what he had seen  so full  that when the candles came to assist his observations  he must  yes  he certainly must  as a friend  an anxious friend  give Emma some hint  ask her some question  He could not see her in a situation of such danger  without trying to preserve her  It was his duty   Pray  Emma  said he   may I ask in what lay the great amusement  the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax  I saw the word  and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one  and so very distressing to the other  Emma was extremely confused  She could not endure to give him the true explanation  for though her suspicions were by no means removed  she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them   Oh  she cried in evident embarrassment   it all meant nothing  a mere joke among ourselves   The joke  he replied gravely   seemed confined to you and Mr  Churchill  He had hoped she would speak again  but she did not  She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak  He sat a little while in doubt  A variety of evils crossed his mind  Interference  fruitless interference  Emma  s confusion  and the acknowledged intimacy  seemed to declare her affection engaged  Yet he would speak  He owed it to her  to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference  rather than her welfare  to encounter any thing  rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause   My dear Emma  said he at last  with earnest kindness   do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of   Between Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax  Oh  yes  perfectly  Why do you make a doubt of it   Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her  or that she admired him   Never  never  she cried with a most open eagerness  Never  for the twentieth part of a moment  did such an idea occur to me  And how could it possibly come into your head   I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them  certain expressive looks  which I did not believe meant to be public   Oh  you amuse me excessively  I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander  but it will not do  very sorry to check you in your first essay  but indeed it will not do  There is no admiration between them  I do assure you  and the appearances which have caught you  have arisen from some peculiar circumstances  feelings rather of a totally different nature  it is impossible exactly to explain  there is a good deal of nonsense in it  but the part which is capable of being communicated  which is sense  is  that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another  as any two beings in the world can be  That is  I _presume_ it to be so on her side  and I can _answer_ for its being so on his  I will answer for the gentleman  s indifference  She spoke with a confidence which staggered  with a satisfaction which silenced  Mr  Knightley  She was in gay spirits  and would have prolonged the conversation  wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions  every look described  and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her  but his gaiety did not meet hers  He found he could not be useful  and his feelings were too much irritated for talking  That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever  by the fire which Mr  Woodhouse  s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year  he soon afterwards took a hasty leave  and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey  CHAPTER VI After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr  and Mrs  Suckling  the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn  No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present  In the daily interchange of news  they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings  coming had been united  such as the last accounts of Mrs  Churchill  whose health seemed every day to supply a different report  and the situation of Mrs  Weston  whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child  as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it  Mrs  Elton was very much disappointed  It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade  Her introductions and recommendations must all wait  and every projected party be still only talked of  So she thought at first  but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off  Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come  They could go there again with them in the autumn  It was settled that they should go to Box Hill  That there was to be such a party had been long generally known  it had even given the idea of another  Emma had never been to Box Hill  she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing  and she and Mr  Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither  Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them  and it was to be done in a quiet  unpretending  elegant way  infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation  the regular eating and drinking  and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings  This was so very well understood between them  that Emma could not but feel some surprise  and a little displeasure  on hearing from Mr  Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs  Elton  as her brother and sister had failed her  that the two parties should unite  and go together  and that as Mrs  Elton had very readily acceded to it  so it was to be  if she had no objection  Now  as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs  Elton  of which Mr  Weston must already be perfectly aware  it was not worth bringing forward again  it could not be done without a reproof to him  which would be giving pain to his wife  and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid  an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs  Elton  s party  Every feeling was offended  and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr  Weston  s temper   I am glad you approve of what I have done  said he very comfortably   But I thought you would  Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers  One cannot have too large a party  A large party secures its own amusement  And she is a good  natured woman after all  One could not leave her out  Emma denied none of it aloud  and agreed to none of it in private  It was now the middle of June  and the weather fine  and Mrs  Elton was growing impatient to name the day  and settle with Mr  Weston as to pigeon  pies and cold lamb  when a lame carriage  horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty  It might be weeks  it might be only a few days  before the horse were useable  but no preparations could be ventured on  and it was all melancholy stagnation  Mrs  Elton  s resources were inadequate to such an attack   Is not this most vexations  Knightley  she cried  And such weather for exploring  These delays and disappointments are quite odious  What are we to do  The year will wear away at this rate  and nothing done  Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston   You had better explore to Donwell  replied Mr  Knightley   That may be done without horses  Come  and eat my strawberries  They are ripening fast  If Mr  Knightley did not begin seriously  he was obliged to proceed so  for his proposal was caught at with delight  and the  Oh  I should like it of all things  was not plainer in words than manner  Donwell was famous for its strawberry  beds  which seemed a plea for the invitation  but no plea was necessary  cabbage  beds would have been enough to tempt the lady  who only wanted to be going somewhere  She promised him again and again to come  much oftener than he doubted  and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy  such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it   You may depend upon me  said she   I certainly will come  Name your day  and I will come  You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax   I cannot name a day  said he   till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you   Oh  leave all that to me  Only give me a carte  blanche  I am Lady Patroness  you know  It is my party  I will bring friends with me   I hope you will bring Elton  said he   but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations   Oh  now you are looking very sly  But consider  you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_  I am no young lady on her preferment  Married women  you know  may be safely authorised  It is my party  Leave it all to me  I will invite your guests   No  he calmly replied  there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell  and that one is   Mrs  Weston  I suppose  interrupted Mrs  Elton  rather mortified   No  Mrs  Knightley  and till she is in being  I will manage such matters myself   Ah  you are an odd creature  she cried  satisfied to have no one preferred to herself  You are a humourist  and may say what you like  Quite a humourist  Well  I shall bring Jane with me  Jane and her aunt  The rest I leave to you  I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family  Don  t scruple  I know you are attached to them   You certainly will meet them if I can prevail  and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home   That  s quite unnecessary  I see Jane every day  but as you like  It is to be a morning scheme  you know  Knightley  quite a simple thing  I shall wear a large bonnet  and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm  Here  probably this basket with pink ribbon  Nothing can be more simple  you see  And Jane will have such another  There is to be no form or parade  a sort of gipsy party  We are to walk about your gardens  and gather the strawberries ourselves  and sit under trees  and whatever else you may like to provide  it is to be all out of doors  a table spread in the shade  you know  Every thing as natural and simple as possible  Is not that your idea   Not quite  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining  room  The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies  with their servants and furniture  I think is best observed by meals within doors  When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden  there shall be cold meat in the house   Well  as you please  only don  t have a great set out  And  by the bye  can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion  Pray be sincere  Knightley  If you wish me to talk to Mrs  Hodges  or to inspect anything   I have not the least wish for it  I thank you   Well  but if any difficulties should arise  my housekeeper is extremely clever   I will answer for it  that mine thinks herself full as clever  and would spurn any body  s assistance   I wish we had a donkey  The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys  Jane  Miss Bates  and me  and my caro sposo walking by  I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey  In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary  for  let a woman have ever so many resources  it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home  and very long walks  you know  in summer there is dust  and in winter there is dirt   You will not find either  between Donwell and Highbury  Donwell Lane is never dusty  and now it is perfectly dry  Come on a donkey  however  if you prefer it  You can borrow Mrs  Cole  s  I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible   That I am sure you would  Indeed I do you justice  my good friend  Under that peculiar sort of dry  blunt manner  I know you have the warmest heart  As I tell Mr  E  you are a thorough humourist  Yes  believe me  Knightley  I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme  You have hit upon the very thing to please me  Mr  Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade  He wished to persuade Mr  Woodhouse  as well as Emma  to join the party  and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill  Mr  Woodhouse must not  under the specious pretence of a morning drive  and an hour or two spent at Donwell  be tempted away to his misery  He was invited on good faith  No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity  He did consent  He had not been at Donwell for two years   Some very fine morning  he  and Emma  and Harriet  could go very well  and he could sit still with Mrs  Weston  while the dear girls walked about the gardens  He did not suppose they could be damp now  in the middle of the day  He should like to see the old house again exceedingly  and should be very happy to meet Mr  and Mrs  Elton  and any other of his neighbours  He could not see any objection at all to his  and Emma  s  and Harriet  s going there some very fine morning  He thought it very well done of Mr  Knightley to invite them  very kind and sensible  much cleverer than dining out  He was not fond of dining out  Mr  Knightley was fortunate in every body  s most ready concurrence  The invitation was everywhere so well received  that it seemed as if  like Mrs  Elton  they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves  Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it  and Mr  Weston  unasked  promised to get Frank over to join them  if possible  a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with  Mr  Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him  and Mr  Weston engaged to lose no time in writing  and spare no arguments to induce him to come  In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast  that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration  and at last Donwell was settled for one day  and Box Hill for the next  the weather appearing exactly right  Under a bright mid  day sun  at almost Midsummer  Mr  Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage  with one window down  to partake of this al  fresco party  and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey  especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning  he was happily placed  quite at his ease  ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved  and advise every body to come and sit down  and not to heat themselves  Mrs  Weston  who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired  and sit all the time with him  remained  when all the others were invited or persuaded out  his patient listener and sympathiser  It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey  that as soon as she was satisfied of her father  s comfort  she was glad to leave him  and look around her  eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation  more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family  She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant  as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building  its suitable  becoming  characteristic situation  low and sheltered  its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream  of which the Abbey  with all the old neglect of prospect  had scarcely a sight  and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues  which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up  The house was larger than Hartfield  and totally unlike it  covering a good deal of ground  rambling and irregular  with many comfortable  and one or two handsome rooms  It was just what it ought to be  and it looked what it was  and Emma felt an increasing respect for it  as the residence of a family of such true gentility  untainted in blood and understanding  Some faults of temper John Knightley had  but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably  She had given them neither men  nor names  nor places  that could raise a blush  These were pleasant feelings  and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did  and collect round the strawberry  beds  The whole party were assembled  excepting Frank Churchill  who was expected every moment from Richmond  and Mrs  Elton  in all her apparatus of happiness  her large bonnet and her basket  was very ready to lead the way in gathering  accepting  or talking  strawberries  and only strawberries  could now be thought or spoken of  The best fruit in England  every body  s favourite  always wholesome  These the finest beds and finest sorts  Delightful to gather for one  s self  the only way of really enjoying them  Morning decidedly the best time  never tired  every sort good  hautboy infinitely superior  no comparison  the others hardly eatable  hautboys very scarce  Chili preferred  white wood finest flavour of all  price of strawberries in London  abundance about Bristol  Maple Grove  cultivation  beds when to be renewed  gardeners thinking exactly different  no general rule  gardeners never to be put out of their way  delicious fruit  only too rich to be eaten much of  inferior to cherries  currants more refreshing  only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping  glaring sun  tired to death  could bear it no longer  must go and sit in the shade  Such  for half an hour  was the conversation  interrupted only once by Mrs  Weston  who came out  in her solicitude after her son  in  law  to inquire if he were come  and she was a little uneasy  She had some fears of his horse  Seats tolerably in the shade were found  and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs  Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of  A situation  a most desirable situation  was in question  Mrs  Elton had received notice of it that morning  and was in raptures  It was not with Mrs  Suckling  it was not with Mrs  Bragge  but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them  it was with a cousin of Mrs  Bragge  an acquaintance of Mrs  Suckling  a lady known at Maple Grove  Delightful  charming  superior  first circles  spheres  lines  ranks  every thing  and Mrs  Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately  On her side  all was warmth  energy  and triumph  and she positively refused to take her friend  s negative  though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing  repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before  Still Mrs  Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow  s post  How Jane could bear it at all  was astonishing to Emma  She did look vexed  she did speak pointedly  and at last  with a decision of action unusual to her  proposed a removal   Should not they walk  Would not Mr  Knightley shew them the gardens  all the gardens  She wished to see the whole extent  The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear  It was hot  and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered  dispersed way  scarcely any three together  they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes  which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river  seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds  It led to nothing  nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars  which seemed intended  in their erection  to give the appearance of an approach to the house  which never had been there  Disputable  however  as might be the taste of such a termination  it was in itself a charming walk  and the view which closed it extremely pretty  The considerable slope  at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood  gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds  and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur  well clothed with wood  and at the bottom of this bank  favourably placed and sheltered  rose the Abbey Mill Farm  with meadows in front  and the river making a close and handsome curve around it  It was a sweet view  sweet to the eye and the mind  English verdure  English culture  English comfort  seen under a sun bright  without being oppressive  In this walk Emma and Mr  Weston found all the others assembled  and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr  Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest  quietly leading the way  Mr  Knightley and Harriet  It was an odd tete  a  tete  but she was glad to see it  There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion  and turned from her with little ceremony  Now they seemed in pleasant conversation  There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm  but now she feared it not  It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty  its rich pastures  spreading flocks  orchard in blossom  and light column of smoke ascending  She joined them at the wall  and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around  He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture  etc  and Emma received a smile which seemed to say   These are my own concerns  I have a right to talk on such subjects  without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin  She did not suspect him  It was too old a story  Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet  They took a few turns together along the walk  The shade was most refreshing  and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day  The next remove was to the house  they must all go in and eat  and they were all seated and busy  and still Frank Churchill did not come  Mrs  Weston looked  and looked in vain  His father would not own himself uneasy  and laughed at her fears  but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare  He had expressed himself as to coming  with more than common certainty   His aunt was so much better  that he had not a doubt of getting over to them  Mrs  Churchill  s state  however  as many were ready to remind her  was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence  and Mrs  Weston was at last persuaded to believe  or to say  that it must be by some attack of Mrs  Churchill that he was prevented coming  Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration  she behaved very well  and betrayed no emotion  The cold repast was over  and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen  the old Abbey fish  ponds  perhaps get as far as the clover  which was to be begun cutting on the morrow  or  at any rate  have the pleasure of being hot  and growing cool again  Mr  Woodhouse  who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens  where no damps from the river were imagined even by him  stirred no more  and his daughter resolved to remain with him  that Mrs  Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need  Mr  Knightley had done all in his power for Mr  Woodhouse  s entertainment  Books of engravings  drawers of medals  cameos  corals  shells  and every other family collection within his cabinets  had been prepared for his old friend  to while away the morning  and the kindness had perfectly answered  Mr  Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused  Mrs  Weston had been shewing them all to him  and now he would shew them all to Emma  fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child  than in a total want of taste for what he saw  for he was slow  constant  and methodical  Before this second looking over was begun  however  Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments  free observation of the entrance and ground  plot of the house  and was hardly there  when Jane Fairfax appeared  coming quickly in from the garden  and with a look of escape  Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon  there was a start at first  but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of   Will you be so kind  said she   when I am missed  as to say that I am gone home  I am going this moment  My aunt is not aware how late it is  nor how long we have been absent  but I am sure we shall be wanted  and I am determined to go directly  I have said nothing about it to any body  It would only be giving trouble and distress  Some are gone to the ponds  and some to the lime walk  Till they all come in I shall not be missed  and when they do  will you have the goodness to say that I am gone   Certainly  if you wish it  but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone   Yes  what should hurt me  I walk fast  I shall be at home in twenty minutes   But it is too far  indeed it is  to be walking quite alone  Let my father  s servant go with you  Let me order the carriage  It can be round in five minutes   Thank you  thank you  but on no account  I would rather walk  And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone  I  who may so soon have to guard others  She spoke with great agitation  and Emma very feelingly replied   That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now  I must order the carriage  The heat even would be danger  You are fatigued already   I am  she answered  I am fatigued  but it is not the sort of fatigue  quick walking will refresh me  Miss Woodhouse  we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits  Mine  I confess  are exhausted  The greatest kindness you can shew me  will be to let me have my own way  and only say that I am gone when it is necessary  Emma had not another word to oppose  She saw it all  and entering into her feelings  promoted her quitting the house immediately  and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend  Her parting look was grateful  and her parting words   Oh  Miss Woodhouse  the comfort of being sometimes alone  seemed to burst from an overcharged heart  and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her  even towards some of those who loved her best   Such a home  indeed  such an aunt  said Emma  as she turned back into the hall again   I do pity you  And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors  the more I shall like you  Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour  and they had only accomplished some views of St  Mark  s Place  Venice  when Frank Churchill entered the room  Emma had not been thinking of him  she had forgotten to think of him  but she was very glad to see him  Mrs  Weston would be at ease  The black mare was blameless  _they_ were right who had named Mrs  Churchill as the cause  He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her  a nervous seizure  which had lasted some hours  and he had quite given up every thought of coming  till very late  and had he known how hot a ride he should have  and how late  with all his hurry  he must be  he believed he should not have come at all  The heat was excessive  he had never suffered any thing like it  almost wished he had staid at home  nothing killed him like heat  he could bear any degree of cold  etc  but heat was intolerable  and he sat down  at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr  Woodhouse  s fire  looking very deplorable   You will soon be cooler  if you sit still  said Emma   As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again  I could very ill be spared  but such a point had been made of my coming  You will all be going soon I suppose  the whole party breaking up  I met _one_ as I came  Madness in such weather  absolute madness  Emma listened  and looked  and soon perceived that Frank Churchill  s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour  Some people were always cross when they were hot  Such might be his constitution  and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints  she recommended his taking some refreshment  he would find abundance of every thing in the dining  room  and she humanely pointed out the door   No  he should not eat  He was not hungry  it would only make him hotter  In two minutes  however  he relented in his own favour  and muttering something about spruce  beer  walked off  Emma returned all her attention to her father  saying in secret   I am glad I have done being in love with him  I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning  Harriet  s sweet easy temper will not mind it  He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal  and came back all the better  grown quite cool  and  with good manners  like himself  able to draw a chair close to them  take an interest in their employment  and regret  in a reasonable way  that he should be so late  He was not in his best spirits  but seemed trying to improve them  and  at last  made himself talk nonsense very agreeably  They were looking over views in Swisserland   As soon as my aunt gets well  I shall go abroad  said he   I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places  You will have my sketches  some time or other  to look at  or my tour to read  or my poem  I shall do something to expose myself   That may be  but not by sketches in Swisserland  You will never go to Swisserland  Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England   They may be induced to go too  A warm climate may be prescribed for her  I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad  I assure you I have  I feel a strong persuasion  this morning  that I shall soon be abroad  I ought to travel  I am tired of doing nothing  I want a change  I am serious  Miss Woodhouse  whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy  I am sick of England  and would leave it to  morrow  if I could   You are sick of prosperity and indulgence  Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself  and be contented to stay   _I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence  You are quite mistaken  I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged  I am thwarted in every thing material  I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person   You are not quite so miserable  though  as when you first came  Go and eat and drink a little more  and you will do very well  Another slice of cold meat  another draught of Madeira and water  will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us   No  I shall not stir  I shall sit by you  You are my best cure   We are going to Box Hill to  morrow  you will join us  It is not Swisserland  but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change  You will stay  and go with us   No  certainly not  I shall go home in the cool of the evening   But you may come again in the cool of to  morrow morning   No  It will not be worth while  If I come  I shall be cross   Then pray stay at Richmond   But if I do  I shall be crosser still  I can never bear to think of you all there without me   These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself  Chuse your own degree of crossness  I shall press you no more  The rest of the party were now returning  and all were soon collected  With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill  others took it very composedly  but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax  s disappearance being explained  That it was time for every body to go  concluded the subject  and with a short final arrangement for the next day  s scheme  they parted  Frank Churchill  s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much  that his last words to Emma were   Well  if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party  I will  She smiled her acceptance  and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening  CHAPTER VII They had a very fine day for Box Hill  and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement  accommodation  and punctuality  were in favour of a pleasant party  Mr  Weston directed the whole  officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage  and every body was in good time  Emma and Harriet went together  Miss Bates and her niece  with the Eltons  the gentlemen on horseback  Mrs  Weston remained with Mr  Woodhouse  Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there  Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment  and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving  but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency  There was a languor  a want of spirits  a want of union  which could not be got over  They separated too much into parties  The Eltons walked together  Mr  Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane  and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill  And Mr  Weston tried  in vain  to make them harmonise better  It seemed at first an accidental division  but it never materially varied  Mr  and Mrs  Elton  indeed  shewed no unwillingness to mix  and be as agreeable as they could  but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill  there seemed a principle of separation  between the other parties  too strong for any fine prospects  or any cold collation  or any cheerful Mr  Weston  to remove  At first it was downright dulness to Emma  She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid  He said nothing worth hearing  looked without seeing  admired without intelligence  listened without knowing what she said  While he was so dull  it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise  and they were both insufferable  When they all sat down it was better  to her taste a great deal better  for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay  making her his first object  Every distinguishing attention that could be paid  was paid to her  To amuse her  and be agreeable in her eyes  seemed all that he cared for  and Emma  glad to be enlivened  not sorry to be flattered  was gay and easy too  and gave him all the friendly encouragement  the admission to be gallant  which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance  but which now  in her own estimation  meant nothing  though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe   Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively  They were laying themselves open to that very phrase  and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady  to Ireland by another  Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity  it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected  She laughed because she was disappointed  and though she liked him for his attentions  and thought them all  whether in friendship  admiration  or playfulness  extremely judicious  they were not winning back her heart  She still intended him for her friend   How much I am obliged to you  said he   for telling me to come to  day  If it had not been for you  I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party  I had quite determined to go away again   Yes  you were very cross  and I do not know what about  except that you were too late for the best strawberries  I was a kinder friend than you deserved  But you were humble  You begged hard to be commanded to come   Don  t say I was cross  I was fatigued  The heat overcame me   It is hotter to  day   Not to my feelings  I am perfectly comfortable to  day   You are comfortable because you are under command   Your command  Yes   Perhaps I intended you to say so  but I meant self  command  You had  somehow or other  broken bounds yesterday  and run away from your own management  but to  day you are got back again  and as I cannot be always with you  it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine   It comes to the same thing  I can have no self  command without a motive  You order me  whether you speak or not  And you can be always with me  You are always with me   Dating from three o  clock yesterday  My perpetual influence could not begin earlier  or you would not have been so much out of humour before   Three o  clock yesterday  That is your date  I thought I had seen you first in February   Your gallantry is really unanswerable  But  lowering her voice  nobody speaks except ourselves  and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people   I say nothing of which I am ashamed  replied he  with lively impudence   I saw you first in February  Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can  Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side  and Dorking on the other  I saw you first in February  And then whispering   Our companions are excessively stupid  What shall we do to rouse them  Any nonsense will serve  They _shall_ talk  Ladies and gentlemen  I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse  who  wherever she is  presides  to say  that she desires to know what you are all thinking of  Some laughed  and answered good  humouredly  Miss Bates said a great deal  Mrs  Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse  s presiding  Mr  Knightley  s answer was the most distinct   Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of   Oh  no  no  cried Emma  laughing as carelessly as she could   Upon no account in the world  It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now  Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of  I will not say quite all  There are one or two  perhaps   glancing at Mr  Weston and Harriet  whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing   It is a sort of thing  cried Mrs  Elton emphatically   which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into  Though  perhaps  as the _Chaperon_ of the party  _I_ never was in any circle  exploring parties  young ladies  married women  Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband  and he murmured  in reply   Very true  my love  very true  Exactly so  indeed  quite unheard of  but some ladies say any thing  Better pass it off as a joke  Every body knows what is due to _you_   It will not do  whispered Frank to Emma   they are most of them affronted  I will attack them with more address  Ladies and gentlemen  I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say  that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of  and only requires something very entertaining from each of you  in a general way  Here are seven of you  besides myself   who  she is pleased to say  am very entertaining already  and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever  be it prose or verse  original or repeated  or two things moderately clever  or three things very dull indeed  and she engages to laugh heartily at them all   Oh  very well  exclaimed Miss Bates   then I need not be uneasy  ` Three things very dull indeed  That will just do for me  you know  I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth  shan  t I   looking round with the most good  humoured dependence on every body  s assent  Do not you all think I shall  Emma could not resist   Ah  ma  am  but there may be a difficulty  Pardon me  but you will be limited as to number  only three at once  Miss Bates  deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner  did not immediately catch her meaning  but  when it burst on her  it could not anger  though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her   Ah  well  to be sure  Yes  I see what she means   turning to Mr  Knightley  and I will try to hold my tongue  I must make myself very disagreeable  or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend   I like your plan  cried Mr  Weston   Agreed  agreed  I will do my best  I am making a conundrum  How will a conundrum reckon   Low  I am afraid  sir  very low  answered his son  but we shall be indulgent  especially to any one who leads the way   No  no  said Emma   it will not reckon low  A conundrum of Mr  Weston  s shall clear him and his next neighbour  Come  sir  pray let me hear it   I doubt its being very clever myself  said Mr  Weston   It is too much a matter of fact  but here it is  What two letters of the alphabet are there  that express perfection   What two letters  express perfection  I am sure I do not know   Ah  you will never guess  You   to Emma  I am certain  will never guess  I will tell you  M  and A  Em  ma  Do you understand  Understanding and gratification came together  It might be a very indifferent piece of wit  but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it  and so did Frank and Harriet  It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally  some looked very stupid about it  and Mr  Knightley gravely said   This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted  and Mr  Weston has done very well for himself  but he must have knocked up every body else  _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon   Oh  for myself  I protest I must be excused  said Mrs  Elton   _I_ really cannot attempt  I am not at all fond of the sort of thing  I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name  which I was not at all pleased with  I knew who it came from  An abominable puppy  You know who I mean  nodding to her husband  These kind of things are very well at Christmas  when one is sitting round the fire  but quite out of place  in my opinion  when one is exploring about the country in summer  Miss Woodhouse must excuse me  I am not one of those who have witty things at every body  s service  I do not pretend to be a wit  I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way  but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue  Pass us  if you please  Mr  Churchill  Pass Mr  E  Knightley  Jane  and myself  We have nothing clever to say  not one of us   Yes  yes  pray pass _me_  added her husband  with a sort of sneering consciousness   _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse  or any other young lady  An old married man  quite good for nothing  Shall we walk  Augusta   With all my heart  I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot  Come  Jane  take my other arm  Jane declined it  however  and the husband and wife walked off   Happy couple  said Frank Churchill  as soon as they were out of hearing  How well they suit one another  Very lucky  marrying as they did  upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place  They only knew each other  I think  a few weeks in Bath  Peculiarly lucky  for as to any real knowledge of a person  s disposition that Bath  or any public place  can give  it is all nothing  there can be no knowledge  It is only by seeing women in their own homes  among their own set  just as they always are  that you can form any just judgment  Short of that  it is all guess and luck  and will generally be ill  luck  How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance  and rued it all the rest of his life  Miss Fairfax  who had seldom spoken before  except among her own confederates  spoke now   Such things do occur  undoubtedly  She was stopped by a cough  Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen   You were speaking  said he  gravely  She recovered her voice   I was only going to observe  that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women  I cannot imagine them to be very frequent  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise  but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards  I would be understood to mean  that it can be only weak  irresolute characters   whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance  who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience  an oppression for ever  He made no answer  merely looked  and bowed in submission  and soon afterwards said  in a lively tone   Well  I have so little confidence in my own judgment  that whenever I marry  I hope some body will chuse my wife for me  Will you   turning to Emma  Will you chuse a wife for me  I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you  You provide for the family  you know   with a smile at his father  Find some body for me  I am in no hurry  Adopt her  educate her   And make her like myself   By all means  if you can   Very well  I undertake the commission  You shall have a charming wife   She must be very lively  and have hazle eyes  I care for nothing else  I shall go abroad for a couple of years  and when I return  I shall come to you for my wife  Remember  Emma was in no danger of forgetting  It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling  Would not Harriet be the very creature described  Hazle eyes excepted  two years more might make her all that he wished  He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment  who could say  Referring the education to her seemed to imply it   Now  ma  am  said Jane to her aunt   shall we join Mrs  Elton   If you please  my dear  With all my heart  I am quite ready  I was ready to have gone with her  but this will do just as well  We shall soon overtake her  There she is  no  that  s somebody else  That  s one of the ladies in the Irish car party  not at all like her  Well  I declare  They walked off  followed in half a minute by Mr  Knightley  Mr  Weston  his son  Emma  and Harriet  only remained  and the young man  s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant  Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment  and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others  or sitting almost alone  and quite unattended to  in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her  The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight  and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart  and the solicitude of Mrs  Elton to have _her_ carriage first  were gladly endured  in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure  Such another scheme  composed of so many ill  assorted people  she hoped never to be betrayed into again  While waiting for the carriage  she found Mr  Knightley by her side  He looked around  as if to see that no one were near  and then said   Emma  I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do  a privilege rather endured than allowed  perhaps  but I must still use it  I cannot see you acting wrong  without a remonstrance  How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates  How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character  age  and situation  Emma  I had not thought it possible  Emma recollected  blushed  was sorry  but tried to laugh it off   Nay  how could I help saying what I did  Nobody could have helped it  It was not so very bad  I dare say she did not understand me   I assure you she did  She felt your full meaning  She has talked of it since  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it  with what candour and generosity  I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance  in being able to pay her such attentions  as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father  when her society must be so irksome   Oh  cried Emma   I know there is not a better creature in the world  but you must allow  that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her   They are blended  said he   I acknowledge  and  were she prosperous  I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good  Were she a woman of fortune  I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance  I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner  Were she your equal in situation  but  Emma  consider how far this is from being the case  She is poor  she has sunk from the comforts she was born to  and  if she live to old age  must probably sink more  Her situation should secure your compassion  It was badly done  indeed  You  whom she had known from an infant  whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour  to have you now  in thoughtless spirits  and the pride of the moment  laugh at her  humble her  and before her niece  too  and before others  many of whom  certainly _some_  would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her  This is not pleasant to you  Emma  and it is very far from pleasant to me  but I must  I will  I will tell you truths while I can  satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel  and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now  While they talked  they were advancing towards the carriage  it was ready  and  before she could speak again  he had handed her in  He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted  and her tongue motionless  They were combined only of anger against herself  mortification  and deep concern  She had not been able to speak  and  on entering the carriage  sunk back for a moment overcome  then reproaching herself for having taken no leave  making no acknowledgment  parting in apparent sullenness  she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference  but it was just too late  He had turned away  and the horses were in motion  She continued to look back  but in vain  and soon  with what appeared unusual speed  they were half way down the hill  and every thing left far behind  She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed  almost beyond what she could conceal  Never had she felt so agitated  mortified  grieved  at any circumstance in her life  She was most forcibly struck  The truth of this representation there was no denying  She felt it at her heart  How could she have been so brutal  so cruel to Miss Bates  How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued  And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude  of concurrence  of common kindness  Time did not compose her  As she reflected more  she seemed but to feel it more  She never had been so depressed  Happily it was not necessary to speak  There was only Harriet  who seemed not in spirits herself  fagged  and very willing to be silent  and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home  without being at any trouble to check them  extraordinary as they were  CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma  s thoughts all the evening  How it might be considered by the rest of the party  she could not tell  They  in their different homes  and their different ways  might be looking back on it with pleasure  but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent  more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time  and more to be abhorred in recollection  than any she had ever passed  A whole evening of back  gammon with her father  was felicity to it  _There_  indeed  lay real pleasure  for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty  four to his comfort  and feeling that  unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem  she could not  in her general conduct  be open to any severe reproach  As a daughter  she hoped she was not without a heart  She hoped no one could have said to her   How could you be so unfeeling to your father  I must  I will tell you truths while I can  Miss Bates should never again  no  never  If attention  in future  could do away the past  she might hope to be forgiven  She had been often remiss  her conscience told her so  remiss  perhaps  more in thought than fact  scornful  ungracious  But it should be so no more  In the warmth of true contrition  she would call upon her the very next morning  and it should be the beginning  on her side  of a regular  equal  kindly intercourse  She was just as determined when the morrow came  and went early  that nothing might prevent her  It was not unlikely  she thought  that she might see Mr  Knightley in her way  or  perhaps  he might come in while she were paying her visit  She had no objection  She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence  so justly and truly hers  Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked  but she saw him not   The ladies were all at home  She had never rejoiced at the sound before  nor ever before entered the passage  nor walked up the stairs  with any wish of giving pleasure  but in conferring obligation  or of deriving it  except in subsequent ridicule  There was a bustle on her approach  a good deal of moving and talking  She heard Miss Bates  s voice  something was to be done in a hurry  the maid looked frightened and awkward  hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment  and then ushered her in too soon  The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room  Jane she had a distinct glimpse of  looking extremely ill  and  before the door had shut them out  she heard Miss Bates saying   Well  my dear  I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed  and I am sure you are ill enough  Poor old Mrs  Bates  civil and humble as usual  looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on   I am afraid Jane is not very well  said she   but I do not know  they _tell_ me she is well  I dare say my daughter will be here presently  Miss Woodhouse  I hope you find a chair  I wish Hetty had not gone  I am very little able  Have you a chair  ma  am  Do you sit where you like  I am sure she will be here presently  Emma seriously hoped she would  She had a moment  s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her  But Miss Bates soon came  Very happy and obliged  but Emma  s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before  less ease of look and manner  A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax  she hoped  might lead the way to a return of old feelings  The touch seemed immediate   Ah  Miss Woodhouse  how kind you are  I suppose you have heard  and are come to give us joy  This does not seem much like joy  indeed  in me  twinkling away a tear or two  but it will be very trying for us to part with her  after having had her so long  and she has a dreadful headache just now  writing all the morning  such long letters  you know  to be written to Colonel Campbell  and Mrs  Dixon  ` My dear  said I  ` you will blind yourself  for tears were in her eyes perpetually  One cannot wonder  one cannot wonder  It is a great change  and though she is amazingly fortunate  such a situation  I suppose  as no young woman before ever met with on first going out  do not think us ungrateful  Miss Woodhouse  for such surprising good fortune  again dispersing her tears  but  poor dear soul  if you were to see what a headache she has  When one is in great pain  you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve  She is as low as possible  To look at her  nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation  You will excuse her not coming to you  she is not able  she is gone into her own room  I want her to lie down upon the bed  ` My dear  said I  ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed  but  however  she is not  she is walking about the room  But  now that she has written her letters  she says she shall soon be well  She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you  Miss Woodhouse  but your kindness will excuse her  You were kept waiting at the door  I was quite ashamed  but somehow there was a little bustle  for it so happened that we had not heard the knock  and till you were on the stairs  we did not know any body was coming  ` It is only Mrs  Cole  said I  ` depend upon it  Nobody else would come so early  ` Well  said she  ` it must be borne some time or other  and it may as well be now  But then Patty came in  and said it was you  ` Oh  said I  ` it is Miss Woodhouse  I am sure you will like to see her  ` I can see nobody  said she  and up she got  and would go away  and that was what made us keep you waiting  and extremely sorry and ashamed we were  ` If you must go  my dear  said I  ` you must  and I will say you are laid down upon the bed  Emma was most sincerely interested  Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane  and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion  and left her nothing but pity  and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past  obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs  Cole or any other steady friend  when she might not bear to see herself  She spoke as she felt  with earnest regret and solicitude  sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on  might be as much for Miss Fairfax  s advantage and comfort as possible   It must be a severe trial to them all  She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell  s return   So very kind  replied Miss Bates   But you are always kind  There was no bearing such an  always  and to break through her dreadful gratitude  Emma made the direct inquiry of   Where  may I ask  is Miss Fairfax going   To a Mrs  Smallridge  charming woman  most superior  to have the charge of her three little girls  delightful children  Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort  if we except  perhaps  Mrs  Suckling  s own family  and Mrs  Bragge  s  but Mrs  Smallridge is intimate with both  and in the very same neighbourhood  lives only four miles from Maple Grove  Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove   Mrs  Elton  I suppose  has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes   Yes  our good Mrs  Elton  The most indefatigable  true friend  She would not take a denial  She would not let Jane say  ` No  for when Jane first heard of it   it was the day before yesterday  the very morning we were at Donwell  when Jane first heard of it  she was quite decided against accepting the offer  and for the reasons you mention  exactly as you say  she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell  s return  and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present  and so she told Mrs  Elton over and over again  and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind  but that good Mrs  Elton  whose judgment never fails her  saw farther than I did  It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did  and refuse to take Jane  s answer  but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday  as Jane wished her  she would wait  and  sure enough  yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go  Quite a surprize to me  I had not the least idea  Jane took Mrs  Elton aside  and told her at once  that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs  Smallridge  s situation  she had come to the resolution of accepting it  I did not know a word of it till it was all settled   You spent the evening with Mrs  Elton   Yes  all of us  Mrs  Elton would have us come  It was settled so  upon the hill  while we were walking about with Mr  Knightley  ` You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us  said she ` I positively must have you _all_ come   Mr  Knightley was there too  was he   No  not Mr  Knightley  he declined it from the first  and though I thought he would come  because Mrs  Elton declared she would not let him off  he did not  but my mother  and Jane  and I  were all there  and a very agreeable evening we had  Such kind friends  you know  Miss Woodhouse  one must always find agreeable  though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning  s party  Even pleasure  you know  is fatiguing  and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it  However  _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party  and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it   Miss Fairfax  I suppose  though you were not aware of it  had been making up her mind the whole day   I dare say she had   Whenever the time may come  it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends  but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible  I mean  as to the character and manners of the family   Thank you  dear Miss Woodhouse  Yes  indeed  there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it  Except the Sucklings and Bragges  there is not such another nursery establishment  so liberal and elegant  in all Mrs  Elton  s acquaintance  Mrs  Smallridge  a most delightful woman  A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove  and as to the children  except the little Sucklings and little Bragges  there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness  It will be nothing but pleasure  a life of pleasure  And her salary  I really cannot venture to name her salary to you  Miss Woodhouse  Even you  used as you are to great sums  would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane   Ah  madam  cried Emma   if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself  I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions  dearly earned   You are so noble in your ideas   And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you   Very soon  very soon  indeed  that  s the worst of it  Within a fortnight  Mrs  Smallridge is in a great hurry  My poor mother does not know how to bear it  So then  I try to put it out of her thoughts  and say  Come ma  am  do not let us think about it any more   Her friends must all be sorry to lose her  and will not Colonel and Mrs  Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return   Yes  Jane says she is sure they will  but yet  this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining  I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs  Elton  and when Mrs  Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it  It was before tea  stay  no  it could not be before tea  because we were just going to cards  and yet it was before tea  because I remember thinking  Oh  no  now I recollect  now I have it  something happened before tea  but not that  Mr  Elton was called out of the room before tea  old John Abdy  s son wanted to speak with him  Poor old John  I have a great regard for him  he was clerk to my poor father twenty  seven years  and now  poor old man  he is bed  ridden  and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints  I must go and see him to  day  and so will Jane  I am sure  if she gets out at all  And poor John  s son came to talk to Mr  Elton about relief from the parish  he is very well to do himself  you know  being head man at the Crown  ostler  and every thing of that sort  but still he cannot keep his father without some help  and so  when Mr  Elton came back  he told us what John ostler had been telling him  and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr  Frank Churchill to Richmond  That was what happened before tea  It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs  Elton  Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her  but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr  Frank Churchill  s going  she proceeded to give them all  it was of no consequence  What Mr  Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject  being the accumulation of the ostler  s own knowledge  and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls  was  that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill  which messenger  however  had been no more than was expected  and that Mr  Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines  containing  upon the whole  a tolerable account of Mrs  Churchill  and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early  but that Mr  Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly  without waiting at all  and his horse seeming to have got a cold  Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise  and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by  the boy going a good pace  and driving very steady  There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest  and it caught Emma  s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind  The contrast between Mrs  Churchill  s importance in the world  and Jane Fairfax  s  struck her  one was every thing  the other nothing  and she sat musing on the difference of woman  s destiny  and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed  till roused by Miss Bates  s saying   Aye  I see what you are thinking of  the pianoforte  What is to become of that  Very true  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now  ` You must go  said she  ` You and I must part  You will have no business here  Let it stay  however  said she  ` give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back  I shall talk about it to him  he will settle for me  he will help me out of all my difficulties  And to this day  I do believe  she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter  s  Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte  and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing  that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough  and  with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt  took leave  CHAPTER IX Emma  s pensive meditations  as she walked home  were not interrupted  but on entering the parlour  she found those who must rouse her  Mr  Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence  and were sitting with her father  Mr  Knightley immediately got up  and in a manner decidedly graver than usual  said   I would not go away without seeing you  but I have no time to spare  and therefore must now be gone directly  I am going to London  to spend a few days with John and Isabella  Have you any thing to send or say  besides the ` love  which nobody carries   Nothing at all  But is not this a sudden scheme   Yes  rather  I have been thinking of it some little time  Emma was sure he had not forgiven her  he looked unlike himself  Time  however  she thought  would tell him that they ought to be friends again  While he stood  as if meaning to go  but not going  her father began his inquiries   Well  my dear  and did you get there safely  And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter  I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming  Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs  and Miss Bates  Mr  Knightley  as I told you before  She is always so attentive to them  Emma  s colour was heightened by this unjust praise  and with a smile  and shake of the head  which spoke much  she looked at Mr  Knightley  It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour  as if his eyes received the truth from her  s  and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured  He looked at her with a glow of regard  She was warmly gratified  and in another moment still more so  by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part  He took her hand  whether she had not herself made the first motion  she could not say  she might  perhaps  have rather offered it  but he took her hand  pressed it  and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips  when  from some fancy or other  he suddenly let it go  Why he should feel such a scruple  why he should change his mind when it was all but done  she could not perceive  He would have judged better  she thought  if he had not stopped  The intention  however  was indubitable  and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry  or however else it happened  but she thought nothing became him more  It was with him  of so simple  yet so dignified a nature  She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction  It spoke such perfect amity  He left them immediately afterwards  gone in a moment  He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory  but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance  Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates  but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier  it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax  s situation with Mr  Knightley  Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square  for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed  but it might have happened at a better time  and to have had longer notice of it  would have been pleasanter  They parted thorough friends  however  she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance  and his unfinished gallantry  it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion  He had been sitting with them half an hour  she found  It was a pity that she had not come back earlier  In the hope of diverting her father  s thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr  Knightley  s going to London  and going so suddenly  and going on horseback  which she knew would be all very bad  Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax  and her dependence on the effect was justified  it supplied a very useful check  interested  without disturbing him  He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax  s going out as governess  and could talk of it cheerfully  but Mr  Knightley  s going to London had been an unexpected blow   I am very glad  indeed  my dear  to hear she is to be so comfortably settled  Mrs  Elton is very good  natured and agreeable  and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be  I hope it is a dry situation  and that her health will be taken good care of  It ought to be a first object  as I am sure poor Miss Taylor  s always was with me  You know  my dear  she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us  And I hope she will be better off in one respect  and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long  The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background  An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs  Churchill  Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account  she had not lived above six  and  thirty hours after his return  A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state  had carried her off after a short struggle  The great Mrs  Churchill was no more  It was felt as such things must be felt  Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow  tenderness towards the departed  solicitude for the surviving friends  and  in a reasonable time  curiosity to know where she would be buried  Goldsmith tells us  that when lovely woman stoops to folly  she has nothing to do but to die  and when she stoops to be disagreeable  it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill  fame  Mrs  Churchill  after being disliked at least twenty  five years  was now spoken of with compassionate allowances  In one point she was fully justified  She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill  The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness  and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints   Poor Mrs  Churchill  no doubt she had been suffering a great deal  more than any body had ever supposed  and continual pain would try the temper  It was a sad event  a great shock  with all her faults  what would Mr  Churchill do without her  Mr  Churchill  s loss would be dreadful indeed  Mr  Churchill would never get over it  Even Mr  Weston shook his head  and looked solemn  and said   Ah  poor woman  who would have thought it  and resolved  that his mourning should be as handsome as possible  and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense  true and steady  How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both  It was also a very early speculation with Emma  The character of Mrs  Churchill  the grief of her husband  her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion  and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event  how benefited  how freed  She saw in a moment all the possible good  Now  an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter  Mr  Churchill  independent of his wife  was feared by nobody  an easy  guidable man  to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew  All that remained to be wished was  that the nephew should form the attachment  as  with all her goodwill in the cause  Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed  Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion  with great self  command  What ever she might feel of brighter hope  she betrayed nothing  Emma was gratified  to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character  and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance  They spoke  therefore  of Mrs  Churchill  s death with mutual forbearance  Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls  communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans  Mr  Churchill was better than could be expected  and their first removal  on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire  was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor  to whom Mr  Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years  At present  there was nothing to be done for Harriet  good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma  s side  It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax  whose prospects were closing  while Harriet  s opened  and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury  who wished to shew her kindness  and with Emma it was grown into a first wish  She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness  and the person  whom she had been so many months neglecting  was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy  She wanted to be of use to her  wanted to shew a value for her society  and testify respect and consideration  She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield  A note was written to urge it  The invitation was refused  and by a verbal message   Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write  and when Mr  Perry called at Hartfield  the same morning  it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited  though against her own consent  by himself  and that she was suffering under severe headaches  and a nervous fever to a degree  which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs  Smallridge  s at the time proposed  Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged  appetite quite gone  and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms  nothing touching the pulmonary complaint  which was the standing apprehension of the family  Mr  Perry was uneasy about her  He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to  and that she felt it so herself  though she would not own it  Her spirits seemed overcome  Her present home  he could not but observe  was unfavourable to a nervous disorder  confined always to one room  he could have wished it otherwise  and her good aunt  though his very old friend  he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description  Her care and attention could not be questioned  they were  in fact  only too great  He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them  Emma listened with the warmest concern  grieved for her more and more  and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful  To take her  be it only an hour or two  from her aunt  to give her change of air and scene  and quiet rational conversation  even for an hour or two  might do her good  and the following morning she wrote again to say  in the most feeling language she could command  that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name  mentioning that she had Mr  Perry  s decided opinion  in favour of such exercise for his patient  The answer was only in this short note   Miss Fairfax  s compliments and thanks  but is quite unequal to any exercise  Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better  but it was impossible to quarrel with words  whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly  and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted  In spite of the answer  therefore  she ordered the carriage  and drove to Mrs  Bates  s  in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her  but it would not do  Miss Bates came to the carriage door  all gratitude  and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service  and every thing that message could do was tried  but all in vain  Miss Bates was obliged to return without success  Jane was quite unpersuadable  the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse  Emma wished she could have seen her  and tried her own powers  but  almost before she could hint the wish  Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in   Indeed  the truth was  that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body  any body at all  Mrs  Elton  indeed  could not be denied  and Mrs  Cole had made such a point  and Mrs  Perry had said so much  but  except them  Jane would really see nobody  Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs  Eltons  the Mrs  Perrys  and the Mrs  Coles  who would force themselves anywhere  neither could she feel any right of preference herself  she submitted  therefore  and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece  s appetite and diet  which she longed to be able to assist  On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy  and very communicative  Jane would hardly eat any thing  Mr  Perry recommended nourishing food  but every thing they could command  and never had any body such good neighbours  was distasteful  Emma  on reaching home  called the housekeeper directly  to an examination of her stores  and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note  In half an hour the arrowroot was returned  with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates  but  dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back  it was a thing she could not take  and  moreover  she insisted on her saying  that she was not at all in want of any thing  When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows  at some distance from Highbury  on the afternoon of the very day on which she had  under the plea of being unequal to any exercise  so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage  she could have no doubt  putting every thing together  that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_  She was sorry  very sorry  Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits  inconsistency of action  and inequality of powers  and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling  or esteemed so little worthy as a friend  but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good  and of being able to say to herself  that could Mr  Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax  could he even have seen into her heart  he would not  on this occasion  have found any thing to reprove  CHAPTER X One morning  about ten days after Mrs  Churchill  s decease  Emma was called downstairs to Mr  Weston  who  could not stay five minutes  and wanted particularly to speak with her  He met her at the parlour  door  and hardly asking her how she did  in the natural key of his voice  sunk it immediately  to say  unheard by her father   Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning  Do  if it be possible  Mrs  Weston wants to see you  She must see you   Is she unwell   No  no  not at all  only a little agitated  She would have ordered the carriage  and come to you  but she must see you _alone_  and that you know  nodding towards her father  Humph  Can you come   Certainly  This moment  if you please  It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way  But what can be the matter  Is she really not ill   Depend upon me  but ask no more questions  You will know it all in time  The most unaccountable business  But hush  hush  To guess what all this meant  was impossible even for Emma  Something really important seemed announced by his looks  but  as her friend was well  she endeavoured not to be uneasy  and settling it with her father  that she would take her walk now  she and Mr  Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls   Now  said Emma  when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates   now Mr  Weston  do let me know what has happened   No  no  he gravely replied  Don  t ask me  I promised my wife to leave it all to her  She will break it to you better than I can  Do not be impatient  Emma  it will all come out too soon   Break it to me  cried Emma  standing still with terror   Good God  Mr  Weston  tell me at once  Something has happened in Brunswick Square  I know it has  Tell me  I charge you tell me this moment what it is   No  indeed you are mistaken   Mr  Weston do not trifle with me  Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square  Which of them is it  I charge you by all that is sacred  not to attempt concealment   Upon my word  Emma   Your word  why not your honour  why not say upon your honour  that it has nothing to do with any of them  Good Heavens  What can be to be _broke_ to me  that does not relate to one of that family   Upon my honour  said he very seriously   it does not  It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley  Emma  s courage returned  and she walked on   I was wrong  he continued   in talking of its being _broke_ to you  I should not have used the expression  In fact  it does not concern you  it concerns only myself  that is  we hope  Humph  In short  my dear Emma  there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it  I don  t say that it is not a disagreeable business  but things might be much worse  If we walk fast  we shall soon be at Randalls  Emma found that she must wait  and now it required little effort  She asked no more questions therefore  merely employed her own fancy  and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern  something just come to light  of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family  something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward  Her fancy was very active  Half a dozen natural children  perhaps  and poor Frank cut off  This  though very undesirable  would be no matter of agony to her  It inspired little more than an animating curiosity   Who is that gentleman on horseback  said she  as they proceeded  speaking more to assist Mr  Weston in keeping his secret  than with any other view   I do not know  One of the Otways  Not Frank  it is not Frank  I assure you  You will not see him  He is half way to Windsor by this time   Has your son been with you  then   Oh  yes  did not you know  Well  well  never mind  For a moment he was silent  and then added  in a tone much more guarded and demure   Yes  Frank came over this morning  just to ask us how we did  They hurried on  and were speedily at Randalls  Well  my dear  said he  as they entered the room  I have brought her  and now I hope you will soon be better  I shall leave you together  There is no use in delay  I shall not be far off  if you want me  And Emma distinctly heard him add  in a lower tone  before he quitted the room  I have been as good as my word  She has not the least idea  Mrs  Weston was looking so ill  and had an air of so much perturbation  that Emma  s uneasiness increased  and the moment they were alone  she eagerly said   What is it my dear friend  Something of a very unpleasant nature  I find  has occurred  do let me know directly what it is  I have been walking all this way in complete suspense  We both abhor suspense  Do not let mine continue longer  It will do you good to speak of your distress  whatever it may be   Have you indeed no idea  said Mrs  Weston in a trembling voice   Cannot you  my dear Emma  cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear   So far as that it relates to Mr  Frank Churchill  I do guess   You are right  It does relate to him  and I will tell you directly   resuming her work  and seeming resolved against looking up   He has been here this very morning  on a most extraordinary errand  It is impossible to express our surprize  He came to speak to his father on a subject  to announce an attachment  She stopped to breathe  Emma thought first of herself  and then of Harriet   More than an attachment  indeed  resumed Mrs  Weston   an engagement  a positive engagement  What will you say  Emma  what will any body say  when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged  nay  that they have been long engaged  Emma even jumped with surprize  and  horror  struck  exclaimed   Jane Fairfax  Good God  You are not serious  You do not mean it   You may well be amazed  returned Mrs  Weston  still averting her eyes  and talking on with eagerness  that Emma might have time to recover   You may well be amazed  But it is even so  There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October  formed at Weymouth  and kept a secret from every body  Not a creature knowing it but themselves  neither the Campbells  nor her family  nor his  It is so wonderful  that though perfectly convinced of the fact  it is yet almost incredible to myself  I can hardly believe it  I thought I knew him  Emma scarcely heard what was said  Her mind was divided between two ideas  her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax  and poor Harriet  and for some time she could only exclaim  and require confirmation  repeated confirmation   Well  said she at last  trying to recover herself   this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day  before I can at all comprehend it  What  engaged to her all the winter  before either of them came to Highbury   Engaged since October  secretly engaged  It has hurt me  Emma  very much  It has hurt his father equally  _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse  Emma pondered a moment  and then replied   I will not pretend _not_ to understand you  and to give you all the relief in my power  be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me  as you are apprehensive of  Mrs  Weston looked up  afraid to believe  but Emma  s countenance was as steady as her words   That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast  of my present perfect indifference  she continued   I will farther tell you  that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance  when I did like him  when I was very much disposed to be attached to him  nay  was attached  and how it came to cease  is perhaps the wonder  Fortunately  however  it did cease  I have really for some time past  for at least these three months  cared nothing about him  You may believe me  Mrs  Weston  This is the simple truth  Mrs  Weston kissed her with tears of joy  and when she could find utterance  assured her  that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do   Mr  Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself  said she   On this point we have been wretched  It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other  and we were persuaded that it was so  Imagine what we have been feeling on your account   I have escaped  and that I should escape  may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself  But this does not acquit _him_  Mrs  Weston  and I must say  that I think him greatly to blame  What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged  and with manners so _very_ disengaged  What right had he to endeavour to please  as he certainly did  to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention  as he certainly did  while he really belonged to another  How could he tell what mischief he might be doing  How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him  very wrong  very wrong indeed   From something that he said  my dear Emma  I rather imagine   And how could _she_ bear such behaviour  Composure with a witness  to look on  while repeated attentions were offering to another woman  before her face  and not resent it  That is a degree of placidity  which I can neither comprehend nor respect   There were misunderstandings between them  Emma  he said so expressly  He had not time to enter into much explanation  He was here only a quarter of an hour  and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay  but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said  The present crisis  indeed  seemed to be brought on by them  and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct   Impropriety  Oh  Mrs  Weston  it is too calm a censure  Much  much beyond impropriety  It has sunk him  I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion  So unlike what a man should be  None of that upright integrity  that strict adherence to truth and principle  that disdain of trick and littleness  which a man should display in every transaction of his life   Nay  dear Emma  now I must take his part  for though he has been wrong in this instance  I have known him long enough to answer for his having many  very many  good qualities  and   Good God  cried Emma  not attending to her  Mrs  Smallridge  too  Jane actually on the point of going as governess  What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy  To suffer her to engage herself  to suffer her even to think of such a measure   He knew nothing about it  Emma  On this article I can fully acquit him  It was a private resolution of hers  not communicated to him  or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction  Till yesterday  I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans  They burst on him  I do not know how  but by some letter or message  and it was the discovery of what she was doing  of this very project of hers  which determined him to come forward at once  own it all to his uncle  throw himself on his kindness  and  in short  put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long  Emma began to listen better   I am to hear from him soon  continued Mrs  Weston   He told me at parting  that he should soon write  and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now  Let us wait  therefore  for this letter  It may bring many extenuations  It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood  Don  t let us be severe  don  t let us be in a hurry to condemn him  Let us have patience  I must love him  and now that I am satisfied on one point  the one material point  I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well  and ready to hope that it may  They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment   _His_ sufferings  replied Emma dryly   do not appear to have done him much harm  Well  and how did Mr  Churchill take it   Most favourably for his nephew  gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty  Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family  While poor Mrs  Churchill lived  I suppose there could not have been a hope  a chance  a possibility  but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault  than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required  What a blessing it is  when undue influence does not survive the grave  He gave his consent with very little persuasion   Ah  thought Emma   he would have done as much for Harriet   This was settled last night  and Frank was off with the light this morning  He stopped at Highbury  at the Bates  s  I fancy  some time  and then came on hither  but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle  to whom he is just now more necessary than ever  that  as I tell you  he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour  He was very much agitated  very much  indeed  to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before  In addition to all the rest  there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell  which he had had no previous suspicion of  and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal   And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy  The Campbells  the Dixons  did none of them know of the engagement  Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush   None  not one  He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves   Well  said Emma   I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea  and I wish them very happy  But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding  What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit  espionage  and treachery  To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity  and such a league in secret to judge us all  Here have we been  the whole winter and spring  completely duped  fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour  with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round  comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear  They must take the consequence  if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable   I am quite easy on that head  replied Mrs  Weston   I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other  which both might not have heard   You are in luck  Your only blunder was confined to my ear  when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady   True  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax  I never could  under any blunder  have spoken ill of her  and as to speaking ill of him  there I must have been safe  At this moment Mr  Weston appeared at a little distance from the window  evidently on the watch  His wife gave him a look which invited him in  and  while he was coming round  added   Now  dearest Emma  let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease  and incline him to be satisfied with the match  Let us make the best of it  and  indeed  almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour  It is not a connexion to gratify  but if Mr  Churchill does not feel that  why should we  and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him  for Frank  I mean  that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for  and still am disposed to give her credit for  in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right  And how much may be said in her situation for even that error   Much  indeed  cried Emma feelingly   If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself  it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax  s  Of such  one may almost say  that ` the world is not their  s  nor the world  s law  She met Mr  Weston on his entrance  with a smiling countenance  exclaiming   A very pretty trick you have been playing me  upon my word  This was a device  I suppose  to sport with my curiosity  and exercise my talent of guessing  But you really frightened me  I thought you had lost half your property  at least  And here  instead of its being a matter of condolence  it turns out to be one of congratulation  I congratulate you  Mr  Weston  with all my heart  on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter  A glance or two between him and his wife  convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed  and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness  he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand  and entered on the subject in a manner to prove  that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing  His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence  or smooth objections  and by the time they had talked it all over together  and he had talked it all over again with Emma  in their walk back to Hartfield  he was become perfectly reconciled  and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done  CHAPTER XI  Harriet  poor Harriet  Those were the words  in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of  and which constituted the real misery of the business to her  Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself  very ill in many ways  but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_  which made her so angry with him  It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet  s account  that gave the deepest hue to his offence  Poor Harriet  to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery  Mr  Knightley had spoken prophetically  when he once said   Emma  you have been no friend to Harriet Smith  She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice  It was true that she had not to charge herself  in this instance as in the former  with being the sole and original author of the mischief  with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet  s imagination  for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject  but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed  She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments  Her influence would have been enough  And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them  She felt that she had been risking her friend  s happiness on most insufficient grounds  Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet  that she must not allow herself to think of him  and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her  But  with common sense  she added   I am afraid I have had little to do  She was extremely angry with herself  If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too  it would have been dreadful  As for Jane Fairfax  she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account  Harriet would be anxiety enough  she need no longer be unhappy about Jane  whose troubles and whose ill  health having  of course  the same origin  must be equally under cure  Her days of insignificance and evil were over  She would soon be well  and happy  and prosperous  Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted  This discovery laid many smaller matters open  No doubt it had been from jealousy  In Jane  s eyes she had been a rival  and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed  An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack  and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison  She understood it all  and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings  she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge  There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else  Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first  Considering the very superior claims of the object  it ought  and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet  s mind  producing reserve and self  command  it would  She must communicate the painful truth  however  and as soon as possible  An injunction of secresy had been among Mr  Weston  s parting words   For the present  the whole affair was to be completely a secret  Mr  Churchill had made a point of it  as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost  and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum  Emma had promised  but still Harriet must be excepted  It was her superior duty  In spite of her vexation  she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous  that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet  which Mrs  Weston had just gone through by herself  The intelligence  which had been so anxiously announced to her  she was now to be anxiously announcing to another  Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet  s footstep and voice  so  she supposed  had poor Mrs  Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls  Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance  But of that  unfortunately  there could be no chance   Well  Miss Woodhouse  cried Harriet  coming eagerly into the room   is not this the oddest news that ever was   What news do you mean  replied Emma  unable to guess  by look or voice  whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint   About Jane Fairfax  Did you ever hear any thing so strange  Oh  you need not be afraid of owning it to me  for Mr  Weston has told me himself  I met him just now  He told me it was to be a great secret  and  therefore  I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you  but he said you knew it   What did Mr  Weston tell you  said Emma  still perplexed   Oh  he told me all about it  that Jane Fairfax and Mr  Frank Churchill are to be married  and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while  How very odd  It was  indeed  so odd  Harriet  s behaviour was so extremely odd  that Emma did not know how to understand it  Her character appeared absolutely changed  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation  or disappointment  or peculiar concern in the discovery  Emma looked at her  quite unable to speak   Had you any idea  cried Harriet   of his being in love with her  You  perhaps  might  You  blushing as she spoke  who can see into every body  s heart  but nobody else   Upon my word  said Emma   I begin to doubt my having any such talent  Can you seriously ask me  Harriet  whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was  tacitly  if not openly  encouraging you to give way to your own feelings  I never had the slightest suspicion  till within the last hour  of Mr  Frank Churchill  s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax  You may be very sure that if I had  I should have cautioned you accordingly   Me  cried Harriet  colouring  and astonished   Why should you caution me  You do not think I care about Mr  Frank Churchill   I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject  replied Emma  smiling   but you do not mean to deny that there was a time  and not very distant either  when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him   Him  never  never  Dear Miss Woodhouse  how could you so mistake me  turning away distressed   Harriet  cried Emma  after a moment  s pause  What do you mean  Good Heaven  what do you mean  Mistake you  Am I to suppose then  She could not speak another word  Her voice was lost  and she sat down  waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer  Harriet  who was standing at some distance  and with face turned from her  did not immediately say any thing  and when she did speak  it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma  s   I should not have thought it possible  she began   that you could have misunderstood me  I know we agreed never to name him  but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else  I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person  Mr  Frank Churchill  indeed  I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other  I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr  Frank Churchill  who is like nobody by his side  And that you should have been so mistaken  is amazing  I am sure  but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment  I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost  to dare to think of him  At first  if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened  that there had been matches of greater disparity  those were your very words  I should not have dared to give way to  I should not have thought it possible  But if _you_  who had been always acquainted with him   Harriet  cried Emma  collecting herself resolutely  Let us understand each other now  without the possibility of farther mistake  Are you speaking of  Mr  Knightley   To be sure I am  I never could have an idea of any body else  and so I thought you knew  When we talked about him  it was as clear as possible   Not quite  returned Emma  with forced calmness   for all that you then said  appeared to me to relate to a different person  I could almost assert that you had _named_ Mr  Frank Churchill  I am sure the service Mr  Frank Churchill had rendered you  in protecting you from the gipsies  was spoken of   Oh  Miss Woodhouse  how you do forget   My dear Harriet  I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion  I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment  that considering the service he had rendered you  it was extremely natural  and you agreed to it  expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service  and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue  The impression of it is strong on my memory   Oh  dear  cried Harriet   now I recollect what you mean  but I was thinking of something very different at the time  It was not the gipsies  it was not Mr  Frank Churchill that I meant  No   with some elevation  I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance  of Mr  Knightley  s coming and asking me to dance  when Mr  Elton would not stand up with me  and when there was no other partner in the room  That was the kind action  that was the noble benevolence and generosity  that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth   Good God  cried Emma   this has been a most unfortunate  most deplorable mistake  What is to be done   You would not have encouraged me  then  if you had understood me  At least  however  I cannot be worse off than I should have been  if the other had been the person  and now  it _is_ possible  She paused a few moments  Emma could not speak   I do not wonder  Miss Woodhouse  she resumed   that you should feel a great difference between the two  as to me or as to any body  You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other  But I hope  Miss Woodhouse  that supposing  that if  strange as it may appear  But you know they were your own words  that _more_ wonderful things had happened  matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than between Mr  Frank Churchill and me  and  therefore  it seems as if such a thing even as this  may have occurred before  and if I should be so fortunate  beyond expression  as to  if Mr  Knightley should really  if _he_ does not mind the disparity  I hope  dear Miss Woodhouse  you will not set yourself against it  and try to put difficulties in the way  But you are too good for that  I am sure  Harriet was standing at one of the windows  Emma turned round to look at her in consternation  and hastily said   Have you any idea of Mr  Knightley  s returning your affection   Yes  replied Harriet modestly  but not fearfully  I must say that I have  Emma  s eyes were instantly withdrawn  and she sat silently meditating  in a fixed attitude  for a few minutes  A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart  A mind like hers  once opening to suspicion  made rapid progress  She touched  she admitted  she acknowledged the whole truth  Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr  Knightley  than with Frank Churchill  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet  s having some hope of a return  It darted through her  with the speed of an arrow  that Mr  Knightley must marry no one but herself  Her own conduct  as well as her own heart  was before her in the same few minutes  She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before  How improperly had she been acting by Harriet  How inconsiderate  how indelicate  how irrational  how unfeeling had been her conduct  What blindness  what madness  had led her on  It struck her with dreadful force  and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world  Some portion of respect for herself  however  in spite of all these demerits  some concern for her own appearance  and a strong sense of justice by Harriet  there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr  Knightley  but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now  gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness  with even apparent kindness  For her own advantage indeed  it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet  s hopes should be enquired into  and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained  or to deserve to be slighted by the person  whose counsels had never led her right  Rousing from reflection  therefore  and subduing her emotion  she turned to Harriet again  and  in a more inviting accent  renewed the conversation  for as to the subject which had first introduced it  the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax  that was quite sunk and lost  Neither of them thought but of Mr  Knightley and themselves  Harriet  who had been standing in no unhappy reverie  was yet very glad to be called from it  by the now encouraging manner of such a judge  and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse  and only wanted invitation  to give the history of her hopes with great  though trembling delight  Emma  s tremblings as she asked  and as she listened  were better concealed than Harriet  s  but they were not less  Her voice was not unsteady  but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self  such a burst of threatening evil  such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions  must create  She listened with much inward suffering  but with great outward patience  to Harriet  s detail  Methodical  or well arranged  or very well delivered  it could not be expected to be  but it contained  when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration  a substance to sink her spirit  especially with the corroborating circumstances  which her own memory brought in favour of Mr  Knightley  s most improved opinion of Harriet  Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances  Emma knew that he had  on that occasion  found her much superior to his expectation  From that evening  or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse  s encouraging her to think of him  Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do  and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her  a manner of kindness and sweetness  Latterly she had been more and more aware of it  When they had been all walking together  he had so often come and walked by her  and talked so very delightfully  He seemed to want to be acquainted with her  Emma knew it to have been very much the case  She had often observed the change  to almost the same extent  Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him  and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet  He praised her for being without art or affectation  for having simple  honest  generous  feelings  She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet  he had dwelt on them to her more than once  Much that lived in Harriet  s memory  many little particulars of the notice she had received from him  a look  a speech  a removal from one chair to another  a compliment implied  a preference inferred  had been unnoticed  because unsuspected  by Emma  Circumstances that might swell to half an hour  s relation  and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them  had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them  but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned  the two of strongest promise to Harriet  were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself  The first  was his walking with her apart from the others  in the lime  walk at Donwell  where they had been walking some time before Emma came  and he had taken pains  as she was convinced  to draw her from the rest to himself  and at first  he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before  in a very particular way indeed  Harriet could not recall it without a blush  He seemed to be almost asking her  whether her affections were engaged  But as soon as she  Miss Woodhouse  appeared likely to join them  he changed the subject  and began talking about farming  The second  was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit  the very last morning of his being at Hartfield  though  when he first came in  he had said that he could not stay five minutes  and his having told her  during their conversation  that though he must go to London  it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all  which was much more  as Emma felt  than he had acknowledged to _her_  The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet  which this one article marked  gave her severe pain  On the subject of the first of the two circumstances  she did  after a little reflection  venture the following question   Might he not  Is not it possible  that when enquiring  as you thought  into the state of your affections  he might be alluding to Mr  Martin  he might have Mr  Martin  s interest in view  But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit   Mr  Martin  No indeed  There was not a hint of Mr  Martin  I hope I know better now  than to care for Mr  Martin  or to be suspected of it  When Harriet had closed her evidence  she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse  to say whether she had not good ground for hope   I never should have presumed to think of it at first  said she   but for you  You told me to observe him carefully  and let his behaviour be the rule of mine  and so I have  But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him  and that if he does chuse me  it will not be any thing so very wonderful  The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech  the many bitter feelings  made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma  s side  to enable her to say on reply   Harriet  I will only venture to declare  that Mr  Knightley is the last man in the world  who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does  Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory  and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness  which at that moment would have been dreadful penance  by the sound of her father  s footsteps  He was coming through the hall  Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him   She could not compose herself  Mr  Woodhouse would be alarmed  she had better go  with most ready encouragement from her friend  therefore  she passed off through another door  and the moment she was gone  this was the spontaneous burst of Emma  s feelings   Oh God  that I had never seen her  The rest of the day  the following night  were hardly enough for her thoughts  She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours  Every moment had brought a fresh surprize  and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her  How to understand it all  How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself  and living under  The blunders  the blindness of her own head and heart  she sat still  she walked about  she tried her own room  she tried the shrubbery  in every place  every posture  she perceived that she had acted most weakly  that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree  that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying  that she was wretched  and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness  To understand  thoroughly understand her own heart  was the first endeavour  To that point went every leisure moment which her father  s claims on her allowed  and every moment of involuntary absence of mind  How long had Mr  Knightley been so dear to her  as every feeling declared him now to be  When had his influence  such influence begun  When had he succeeded to that place in her affection  which Frank Churchill had once  for a short period  occupied  She looked back  she compared the two  compared them  as they had always stood in her estimation  from the time of the latter  s becoming known to her  and as they must at any time have been compared by her  had it  oh  had it  by any blessed felicity  occurred to her  to institute the comparison  She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr  Knightley as infinitely the superior  or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear  She saw  that in persuading herself  in fancying  in acting to the contrary  she had been entirely under a delusion  totally ignorant of her own heart  and  in short  that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all  This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection  This was the knowledge of herself  on the first question of inquiry  which she reached  and without being long in reaching it  She was most sorrowfully indignant  ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her  her affection for Mr  Knightley  Every other part of her mind was disgusting  With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body  s feelings  with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body  s destiny  She was proved to have been universally mistaken  and she had not quite done nothing  for she had done mischief  She had brought evil on Harriet  on herself  and she too much feared  on Mr  Knightley  Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place  on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning  for his attachment  she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet  s  and even were this not the case  he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly  Mr  Knightley and Harriet Smith  It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind  The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace  threadbare  stale in the comparison  exciting no surprize  presenting no disparity  affording nothing to be said or thought  Mr  Knightley and Harriet Smith  Such an elevation on her side  Such a debasement on his  It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion  to foresee the smiles  the sneers  the merriment it would prompt at his expense  the mortification and disdain of his brother  the thousand inconveniences to himself  Could it be  No  it was impossible  And yet it was far  very far  from impossible  Was it a new circumstance for a man of first  rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers  Was it new for one  perhaps too busy to seek  to be the prize of a girl who would seek him  Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal  inconsistent  incongruous  or for chance and circumstance  as second causes  to direct the human fate  Oh  had she never brought Harriet forward  Had she left her where she ought  and where he had told her she ought  Had she not  with a folly which no tongue could express  prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong  all would have been safe  none of this dreadful sequel would have been  How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr  Knightley  How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it  But Harriet was less humble  had fewer scruples than formerly  Her inferiority  whether of mind or situation  seemed little felt  She had seemed more sensible of Mr  Elton  s being to stoop in marrying her  than she now seemed of Mr  Knightley  s  Alas  was not that her own doing too  Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self  consequence but herself  Who but herself had taught her  that she was to elevate herself if possible  and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment  If Harriet  from being humble  were grown vain  it was her doing too  CHAPTER XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss  Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr  Knightley  first in interest and affection  Satisfied that it was so  and feeling it her due  she had enjoyed it without reflection  and only in the dread of being supplanted  found how inexpressibly important it had been  Long  very long  she felt she had been first  for  having no female connexions of his own  there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers  and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella  She had herself been first with him for many years past  She had not deserved it  she had often been negligent or perverse  slighting his advice  or even wilfully opposing him  insensible of half his merits  and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own  but still  from family attachment and habit  and thorough excellence of mind  he had loved her  and watched over her from a girl  with an endeavour to improve her  and an anxiety for her doing right  which no other creature had at all shared  In spite of all her faults  she knew she was dear to him  might she not say  very dear  When the suggestions of hope  however  which must follow here  presented themselves  she could not presume to indulge them  Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly  exclusively  passionately loved by Mr  Knightley  _She_ could not  She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_  She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality  How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates  How directly  how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject  Not too strongly for the offence  but far  far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear  sighted goodwill  She had no hope  nothing to deserve the name of hope  that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question  but there was a hope  at times a slight one  at times much stronger  that Harriet might have deceived herself  and be overrating his regard for _her_  Wish it she must  for his sake  be the consequence nothing to herself  but his remaining single all his life  Could she be secure of that  indeed  of his never marrying at all  she believed she should be perfectly satisfied  Let him but continue the same Mr  Knightley to her and her father  the same Mr  Knightley to all the world  let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence  and her peace would be fully secured  Marriage  in fact  would not do for her  It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father  and with what she felt for him  Nothing should separate her from her father  She would not marry  even if she were asked by Mr  Knightley  It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed  and she hoped  that when able to see them together again  she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were  She should see them henceforward with the closest observance  and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching  she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here  He was expected back every day  The power of observation would be soon given  frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course  In the meanwhile  she resolved against seeing Harriet  It would do neither of them good  it would do the subject no good  to be talking of it farther  She was resolved not to be convinced  as long as she could doubt  and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet  s confidence  To talk would be only to irritate  She wrote to her  therefore  kindly  but decisively  to beg that she would not  at present  come to Hartfield  acknowledging it to be her conviction  that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided  and hoping  that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again  except in the company of others  she objected only to a tete  a  tete  they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday  Harriet submitted  and approved  and was grateful  This point was just arranged  when a visitor arrived to tear Emma  s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them  sleeping or waking  the last twenty  four hours  Mrs  Weston  who had been calling on her daughter  in  law elect  and took Hartfield in her way home  almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself  to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview  Mr  Weston had accompanied her to Mrs  Bates  s  and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely  but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing  was now returned with much more to say  and much more to say with satisfaction  than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs  Bates  s parlour  with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings  could have afforded  A little curiosity Emma had  and she made the most of it while her friend related  Mrs  Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself  and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present  to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead  and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed  and Mr  Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement  s becoming known  as  considering every thing  she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports  but Mr  Weston had thought differently  he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family  and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it  or if it were  that it would be of any consequence  for  such things  he observed   always got about  Emma smiled  and felt that Mr  Weston had very good reason for saying so  They had gone  in short  and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady  She had hardly been able to speak a word  and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness  The quiet  heart  felt satisfaction of the old lady  and the rapturous delight of her daughter  who proved even too joyous to talk as usual  had been a gratifying  yet almost an affecting  scene  They were both so truly respectable in their happiness  so disinterested in every sensation  thought so much of Jane  so much of every body  and so little of themselves  that every kindly feeling was at work for them  Miss Fairfax  s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs  Weston to invite her to an airing  she had drawn back and declined at first  but  on being pressed had yielded  and  in the course of their drive  Mrs  Weston had  by gentle encouragement  overcome so much of her embarrassment  as to bring her to converse on the important subject  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception  and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr  Weston  must necessarily open the cause  but when these effusions were put by  they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement  Mrs  Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion  pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been  and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject   On the misery of what she had suffered  during the concealment of so many months  continued Mrs  Weston   she was energetic  This was one of her expressions  ` I will not say  that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments  but I can say  that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour  and the quivering lip  Emma  which uttered it  was an attestation that I felt at my heart   Poor girl  said Emma   She thinks herself wrong  then  for having consented to a private engagement   Wrong  No one  I believe  can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself  ` The consequence  said she  ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me  and so it ought  But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring  it is still not less misconduct  Pain is no expiation  I never can be blameless  I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right  and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken  and the kindness I am now receiving  is what my conscience tells me ought not to be  ` Do not imagine  madam  she continued  ` that I was taught wrong  Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up  The error has been all my own  and I do assure you that  with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give  I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell   Poor girl  said Emma again   She loves him then excessively  I suppose  It must have been from attachment only  that she could be led to form the engagement  Her affection must have overpowered her judgment   Yes  I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him   I am afraid  returned Emma  sighing   that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy   On your side  my love  it was very innocently done  But she probably had something of that in her thoughts  when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before  One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in  she said   was that of making her _unreasonable_  The consciousness of having done amiss  had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes  and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been  that had been  hard for him to bear  ` I did not make the allowances  said she  ` which I ought to have done  for his temper and spirits  his delightful spirits  and that gaiety  that playfulness of disposition  which  under any other circumstances  would  I am sure  have been as constantly bewitching to me  as they were at first  She then began to speak of you  and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness  and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected  desired me  whenever I had an opportunity  to thank you  I could not thank you too much  for every wish and every endeavour to do her good  She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself   If I did not know her to be happy now  said Emma  seriously   which  in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience  she must be  I could not bear these thanks  for  oh  Mrs  Weston  if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax  Well  checking herself  and trying to be more lively  this is all to be forgotten  You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars  They shew her to the greatest advantage  I am sure she is very good  I hope she will be very happy  It is fit that the fortune should be on his side  for I think the merit will be all on hers  Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs  Weston  She thought well of Frank in almost every respect  and  what was more  she loved him very much  and her defence was  therefore  earnest  She talked with a great deal of reason  and at least equal affection  but she had too much to urge for Emma  s attention  it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell  she forgot to attempt to listen  and when Mrs  Weston ended with   We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for  you know  but I hope it will soon come  she was obliged to pause before she answered  and at last obliged to answer at random  before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for   Are you well  my Emma  was Mrs  Weston  s parting question   Oh  perfectly  I am always well  you know  Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible  Mrs  Weston  s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection  by increasing her esteem and compassion  and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax  She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her  and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been  in some measure  the cause  Had she followed Mr  Knightley  s known wishes  in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax  which was every way her due  had she tried to know her better  had she done her part towards intimacy  had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith  she must  in all probability  have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now  Birth  abilities  and education  had been equally marking one as an associate for her  to be received with gratitude  and the other  what was she  Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends  that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax  s confidence on this important matter  which was most probable  still  in knowing her as she ought  and as she might  she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr  Dixon  which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself  but had so unpardonably imparted  an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane  s feelings  by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill  s  Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former  since her coming to Highbury  she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst  She must have been a perpetual enemy  They never could have been all three together  without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax  s peace in a thousand instances  and on Box Hill  perhaps  it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more  The evening of this day was very long  and melancholy  at Hartfield  The weather added what it could of gloom  A cold stormy rain set in  and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs  which the wind was despoiling  and the length of the day  which only made such cruel sights the longer visible  The weather affected Mr  Woodhouse  and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter  s side  and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before  It reminded her of their first forlorn tete  a  tete  on the evening of Mrs  Weston  s wedding  day  but Mr  Knightley had walked in then  soon after tea  and dissipated every melancholy fancy  Alas  such delightful proofs of Hartfield  s attraction  as those sort of visits conveyed  might shortly be over  The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter  had proved erroneous  no friends had deserted them  no pleasures had been lost  But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction  The prospect before her now  was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled  that might not be even partially brightened  If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends  Hartfield must be comparatively deserted  and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness  The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself  and Mrs  Weston  s heart and time would be occupied by it  They should lose her  and  probably  in great measure  her husband also  Frank Churchill would return among them no more  and Miss Fairfax  it was reasonable to suppose  would soon cease to belong to Highbury  They would be married  and settled either at or near Enscombe  All that were good would be withdrawn  and if to these losses  the loss of Donwell were to be added  what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach  Mr  Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort  No longer walking in at all hours  as if ever willing to change his own home for their  s  How was it to be endured  And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet  s sake  if he were to be thought of hereafter  as finding in Harriet  s society all that he wanted  if Harriet were to be the chosen  the first  the dearest  the friend  the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence  what could be increasing Emma  s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind  that it had been all her own work  When it came to such a pitch as this  she was not able to refrain from a start  or a heavy sigh  or even from walking about the room for a few seconds  and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn  was in the resolution of her own better conduct  and the hope that  however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past  it would yet find her more rational  more acquainted with herself  and leave her less to regret when it were gone  CHAPTER XIII The weather continued much the same all the following morning  and the same loneliness  and the same melancholy  seemed to reign at Hartfield  but in the afternoon it cleared  the wind changed into a softer quarter  the clouds were carried off  the sun appeared  it was summer again  With all the eagerness which such a transition gives  Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible  Never had the exquisite sight  smell  sensation of nature  tranquil  warm  and brilliant after a storm  been more attractive to her  She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce  and on Mr  Perry  s coming in soon after dinner  with a disengaged hour to give her father  she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery  There  with spirits freshened  and thoughts a little relieved  she had taken a few turns  when she saw Mr  Knightley passing through the garden door  and coming towards her  It was the first intimation of his being returned from London  She had been thinking of him the moment before  as unquestionably sixteen miles distant  There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind  She must be collected and calm  In half a minute they were together  The  How d  ye do  s  were quiet and constrained on each side  She asked after their mutual friends  they were all well  When had he left them  Only that morning  He must have had a wet ride  Yes  He meant to walk with her  she found   He had just looked into the dining  room  and as he was not wanted there  preferred being out of doors  She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully  and the first possible cause for it  suggested by her fears  was  that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother  and was pained by the manner in which they had been received  They walked together  He was silent  She thought he was often looking at her  and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give  And this belief produced another dread  Perhaps he wanted to speak to her  of his attachment to Harriet  he might be watching for encouragement to begin  She did not  could not  feel equal to lead the way to any such subject  He must do it all himself  Yet she could not bear this silence  With him it was most unnatural  She considered  resolved  and  trying to smile  began   You have some news to hear  now you are come back  that will rather surprize you   Have I  said he quietly  and looking at her   of what nature   Oh  the best nature in the world  a wedding  After waiting a moment  as if to be sure she intended to say no more  he replied   If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill  I have heard that already   How is it possible  cried Emma  turning her glowing cheeks towards him  for  while she spoke  it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs  Goddard  s in his way   I had a few lines on parish business from Mr  Weston this morning  and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened  Emma was quite relieved  and could presently say  with a little more composure   _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us  for you have had your suspicions  I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution  I wish I had attended to it  but  with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh  I seem to have been doomed to blindness  For a moment or two nothing was said  and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest  till she found her arm drawn within his  and pressed against his heart  and heard him thus saying  in a tone of great sensibility  speaking low   Time  my dearest Emma  time will heal the wound  Your own excellent sense  your exertions for your father  s sake  I know you will not allow yourself  Her arm was pressed again  as he added  in a more broken and subdued accent   The feelings of the warmest friendship  Indignation  Abominable scoundrel  And in a louder  steadier tone  he concluded with   He will soon be gone  They will soon be in Yorkshire  I am sorry for _her_  She deserves a better fate  Emma understood him  and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure  excited by such tender consideration  replied   You are very kind  but you are mistaken  and I must set you right  I am not in want of that sort of compassion  My blindness to what was going on  led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of  and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures  but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier   Emma  cried he  looking eagerly at her   are you  indeed  but checking himself  No  no  I understand you  forgive me  I am pleased that you can say even so much  He is no object of regret  indeed  and it will not be very long  I hope  before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason  Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled  I could never  I confess  from your manners  assure myself as to the degree of what you felt  I could only be certain that there was a preference  and a preference which I never believed him to deserve  He is a disgrace to the name of man  And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman  Jane  Jane  you will be a miserable creature   Mr  Knightley  said Emma  trying to be lively  but really confused   I am in a very extraordinary situation  I cannot let you continue in your error  and yet  perhaps  since my manners gave such an impression  I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of  as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse  But I never have  He listened in perfect silence  She wished him to speak  but he would not  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency  but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion  She went on  however   I have very little to say for my own conduct  I was tempted by his attentions  and allowed myself to appear pleased  An old story  probably  a common case  and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before  and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding  Many circumstances assisted the temptation  He was the son of Mr  Weston  he was continually here  I always found him very pleasant  and  in short  for  with a sigh  let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously  they all centre in this at last  my vanity was flattered  and I allowed his attentions  Latterly  however  for some time  indeed  I have had no idea of their meaning any thing  I thought them a habit  a trick  nothing that called for seriousness on my side  He has imposed on me  but he has not injured me  I have never been attached to him  And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour  He never wished to attach me  It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another  It was his object to blind all about him  and no one  I am sure  could be more effectually blinded than myself  except that I was _not_ blinded  that it was my good fortune  that  in short  I was somehow or other safe from him  She had hoped for an answer here  for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible  but he was silent  and  as far as she could judge  deep in thought  At last  and tolerably in his usual tone  he said   I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill  I can suppose  however  that I may have underrated him  My acquaintance with him has been but trifling  And even if I have not underrated him hitherto  he may yet turn out well  With such a woman he has a chance  I have no motive for wishing him ill  and for her sake  whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct  I shall certainly wish him well   I have no doubt of their being happy together  said Emma   I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached   He is a most fortunate man  returned Mr  Knightley  with energy   So early in life  at three  and  twenty  a period when  if a man chuses a wife  he generally chuses ill  At three  and  twenty to have drawn such a prize  What years of felicity that man  in all human calculation  has before him  Assured of the love of such a woman  the disinterested love  for Jane Fairfax  s character vouches for her disinterestedness  every thing in his favour  equality of situation  I mean  as far as regards society  and all the habits and manners that are important  equality in every point but one  and that one  since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted  such as must increase his felicity  for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants  A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from  and he who can do it  where there is no doubt of _her_ regard  must  I think  be the happiest of mortals  Frank Churchill is  indeed  the favourite of fortune  Every thing turns out for his good  He meets with a young woman at a watering  place  gains her affection  cannot even weary her by negligent treatment  and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him  they could not have found her superior  His aunt is in the way  His aunt dies  He has only to speak  His friends are eager to promote his happiness  He had used every body ill  and they are all delighted to forgive him  He is a fortunate man indeed   You speak as if you envied him   And I do envy him  Emma  In one respect he is the object of my envy  Emma could say no more  They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet  and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject  if possible  She made her plan  she would speak of something totally different  the children in Brunswick Square  and she only waited for breath to begin  when Mr  Knightley startled her  by saying   You will not ask me what is the point of envy  You are determined  I see  to have no curiosity  You are wise  but _I_ cannot be wise  Emma  I must tell you what you will not ask  though I may wish it unsaid the next moment   Oh  then  don  t speak it  don  t speak it  she eagerly cried   Take a little time  consider  do not commit yourself   Thank you  said he  in an accent of deep mortification  and not another syllable followed  Emma could not bear to give him pain  He was wishing to confide in her  perhaps to consult her  cost her what it would  she would listen  She might assist his resolution  or reconcile him to it  she might give just praise to Harriet  or  by representing to him his own independence  relieve him from that state of indecision  which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his  They had reached the house   You are going in  I suppose  said he   No  replied Emma  quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke  I should like to take another turn  Mr  Perry is not gone  And  after proceeding a few steps  she added   I stopped you ungraciously  just now  Mr  Knightley  and  I am afraid  gave you pain  But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend  or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation  as a friend  indeed  you may command me  I will hear whatever you like  I will tell you exactly what I think   As a friend  repeated Mr  Knightley  Emma  that I fear is a word  No  I have no wish  Stay  yes  why should I hesitate  I have gone too far already for concealment  Emma  I accept your offer  Extraordinary as it may seem  I accept it  and refer myself to you as a friend  Tell me  then  have I no chance of ever succeeding  He stopped in his earnestness to look the question  and the expression of his eyes overpowered her   My dearest Emma  said he   for dearest you will always be  whatever the event of this hour  s conversation  my dearest  most beloved Emma  tell me at once  Say ` No  if it is to be said  She could really say nothing  You are silent  he cried  with great animation   absolutely silent  at present I ask no more  Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment  The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream  was perhaps the most prominent feeling   I cannot make speeches  Emma  he soon resumed  and in a tone of such sincere  decided  intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing  If I loved you less  I might be able to talk about it more  But you know what I am  You hear nothing but truth from me  I have blamed you  and lectured you  and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it  Bear with the truths I would tell you now  dearest Emma  as well as you have borne with them  The manner  perhaps  may have as little to recommend them  God knows  I have been a very indifferent lover  But you understand me  Yes  you see  you understand my feelings  and will return them if you can  At present  I ask only to hear  once to hear your voice  While he spoke  Emma  s mind was most busy  and  with all the wonderful velocity of thought  had been able  and yet without losing a word  to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole  to see that Harriet  s hopes had been entirely groundless  a mistake  a delusion  as complete a delusion as any of her own  that Harriet was nothing  that she was every thing herself  that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings  and that her agitation  her doubts  her reluctance  her discouragement  had been all received as discouragement from herself  And not only was there time for these convictions  with all their glow of attendant happiness  there was time also to rejoice that Harriet  s secret had not escaped her  and to resolve that it need not  and should not  It was all the service she could now render her poor friend  for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet  as infinitely the most worthy of the two  or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever  without vouchsafing any motive  because he could not marry them both  Emma had it not  She felt for Harriet  with pain and with contrition  but no flight of generosity run mad  opposing all that could be probable or reasonable  entered her brain  She had led her friend astray  and it would be a reproach to her for ever  but her judgment was as strong as her feelings  and as strong as it had ever been before  in reprobating any such alliance for him  as most unequal and degrading  Her way was clear  though not quite smooth  She spoke then  on being so entreated  What did she say  Just what she ought  of course  A lady always does  She said enough to shew there need not be despair  and to invite him to say more himself  He _had_ despaired at one period  he had received such an injunction to caution and silence  as for the time crushed every hope  she had begun by refusing to hear him  The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden  her proposal of taking another turn  her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to  might be a little extraordinary  She felt its inconsistency  but Mr  Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it  and seek no farther explanation  Seldom  very seldom  does complete truth belong to any human disclosure  seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised  or a little mistaken  but where  as in this case  though the conduct is mistaken  the feelings are not  it may not be very material  Mr  Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed  or a heart more disposed to accept of his  He had  in fact  been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence  He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it  He had come  in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill  s engagement  with no selfish view  no view at all  but of endeavouring  if she allowed him an opening  to soothe or to counsel her  The rest had been the work of the moment  the immediate effect of what he heard  on his feelings  The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill  of her having a heart completely disengaged from him  had given birth to the hope  that  in time  he might gain her affection himself  but it had been no present hope  he had only  in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment  aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her  The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting  The affection  which he had been asking to be allowed to create  if he could  was already his  Within half an hour  he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind  to something so like perfect happiness  that it could bear no other name  _Her_ change was equal  This one half  hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved  had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance  jealousy  or distrust  On his side  there had been a long  standing jealousy  old as the arrival  or even the expectation  of Frank Churchill  He had been in love with Emma  and jealous of Frank Churchill  from about the same period  one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other  It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country  The Box Hill party had decided him on going away  He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted  encouraged attentions  He had gone to learn to be indifferent  But he had gone to a wrong place  There was too much domestic happiness in his brother  s house  woman wore too amiable a form in it  Isabella was too much like Emma  differing only in those striking inferiorities  which always brought the other in brilliancy before him  for much to have been done  even had his time been longer  He had stayed on  however  vigorously  day after day  till this very morning  s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax  Then  with the gladness which must be felt  nay  which he did not scruple to feel  having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma  was there so much fond solicitude  so much keen anxiety for her  that he could stay no longer  He had ridden home through the rain  and had walked up directly after dinner  to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures  faultless in spite of all her faults  bore the discovery  He had found her agitated and low  Frank Churchill was a villain  He heard her declare that she had never loved him  Frank Churchill  s character was not desperate  She was his own Emma  by hand and word  when they returned into the house  and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then  he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow  CHAPTER XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out  she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering  she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness  and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away  They sat down to tea  the same party round the same table  how often it had been collected  and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn  and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun  But never in such a state of spirits  never in any thing like it  and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house  or even the attentive daughter  Poor Mr  Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming  and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride  Could he have seen the heart  he would have cared very little for the lungs  but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil  without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either  he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr  Perry  and talked on with much self  contentment  totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return  As long as Mr  Knightley remained with them  Emma  s fever continued  but when he was gone  she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued  and in the course of the sleepless night  which was the tax for such an evening  she found one or two such very serious points to consider  as made her feel  that even her happiness must have some alloy  Her father  and Harriet  She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims  and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost  was the question  With respect to her father  it was a question soon answered  She hardly knew yet what Mr  Knightley would ask  but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father  She even wept over the idea of it  as a sin of thought  While he lived  it must be only an engagement  but she flattered herself  that if divested of the danger of drawing her away  it might become an increase of comfort to him  How to do her best by Harriet  was of more difficult decision  how to spare her from any unnecessary pain  how to make her any possible atonement  how to appear least her enemy  On these subjects  her perplexity and distress were very great  and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it  She could only resolve at last  that she would still avoid a meeting with her  and communicate all that need be told by letter  that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury  and  indulging in one scheme more  nearly resolve  that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square  Isabella had been pleased with Harriet  and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement  She did not think it in Harriet  s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety  by the streets  the shops  and the children  At any rate  it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself  from whom every thing was due  a separation for the present  an averting of the evil day  when they must all be together again  She rose early  and wrote her letter to Harriet  an employment which left her so very serious  so nearly sad  that Mr  Knightley  in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast  did not arrive at all too soon  and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him  literally and figuratively  was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before  He had not left her long  by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else  when a letter was brought her from Randalls  a very thick letter  she guessed what it must contain  and deprecated the necessity of reading it  She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill  she wanted no explanations  she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself  and as for understanding any thing he wrote  she was sure she was incapable of it  It must be waded through  however  She opened the packet  it was too surely so  a note from Mrs  Weston to herself  ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs  Weston   I have the greatest pleasure  my dear Emma  in forwarding to you the enclosed  I know what thorough justice you will do it  and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect  I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again  but I will not delay you by a long preface  We are quite well  This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately  I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday  but it was an ungenial morning  and though you will never own being affected by weather  I think every body feels a north  east wind  I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning  but had the comfort of hearing last night  by Mr  Perry  that it had not made him ill   Yours ever   A  W  [ To Mrs  Weston ] WINDSOR  JULY  MY DEAR MADAM   If I made myself intelligible yesterday  this letter will be expected  but expected or not  I know it will be read with candour and indulgence  You are all goodness  and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct  But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent  My courage rises while I write  It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble  I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon  that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours  and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence  You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls  you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards  This was the fact  My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment  is another question  I shall not discuss it here  For my temptation to _think_ it a right  I refer every caviller to a brick house  sashed windows below  and casements above  in Highbury  I dared not address her openly  my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition  and I was fortunate enough to prevail  before we parted at Weymouth  and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement  Had she refused  I should have gone mad  But you will be ready to say  what was your hope in doing this  What did you look forward to  To any thing  every thing  to time  chance  circumstance  slow effects  sudden bursts  perseverance and weariness  health and sickness  Every possibility of good was before me  and the first of blessings secured  in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence  If you need farther explanation  I have the honour  my dear madam  of being your husband  s son  and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good  which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of  See me  then  under these circumstances  arriving on my first visit to Randalls  and here I am conscious of wrong  for that visit might have been sooner paid  You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury  and as _you_ were the person slighted  you will forgive me instantly  but I must work on my father  s compassion  by reminding him  that so long as I absented myself from his house  so long I lost the blessing of knowing you  My behaviour  during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you  did not  I hope  lay me open to reprehension  excepting on one point  And now I come to the principal  the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you  which excites my own anxiety  or requires very solicitous explanation  With the greatest respect  and the warmest friendship  do I mention Miss Woodhouse  my father perhaps will think I ought to add  with the deepest humiliation  A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion  and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to  My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated  I believe  more than it ought  In order to assist a concealment so essential to me  I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown  I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object  but I am sure you will believe the declaration  that had I not been convinced of her indifference  I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on  Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is  she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached  and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me  was as much my conviction as my wish  She received my attentions with an easy  friendly  goodhumoured playfulness  which exactly suited me  We seemed to understand each other  From our relative situation  those attentions were her due  and were felt to be so  Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight  I cannot say  when I called to take leave of her  I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth  and I then fancied she was not without suspicion  but I have no doubt of her having since detected me  at least in some degree  She may not have surmised the whole  but her quickness must have penetrated a part  I cannot doubt it  You will find  whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints  that it did not take her wholly by surprize  She frequently gave me hints of it  I remember her telling me at the ball  that I owed Mrs  Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax  I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss  While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse  I could deserve nothing from either  Acquit me here  and procure for me  when it is allowable  the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse  whom I regard with so much brotherly affection  as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself  Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight  you have now a key to  My heart was in Highbury  and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be  and with the least suspicion  If you remember any queernesses  set them all to the right account  Of the pianoforte so much talked of  I feel it only necessary to say  that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F  who would never have allowed me to send it  had any choice been given her  The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement  my dear madam  is much beyond my power of doing justice to  You will soon  I earnestly hope  know her thoroughly yourself  No description can describe her  She must tell you herself what she is  yet not by word  for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit  Since I began this letter  which will be longer than I foresaw  I have heard from her  She gives a good account of her own health  but as she never complains  I dare not depend  I want to have your opinion of her looks  I know you will soon call on her  she is living in dread of the visit  Perhaps it is paid already  Let me hear from you without delay  I am impatient for a thousand particulars  Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls  and in how bewildered  how mad a state  and I am not much better yet  still insane either from happiness or misery  When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with  of her excellence and patience  and my uncle  s generosity  I am mad with joy  but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her  and how little I deserve to be forgiven  I am mad with anger  If I could but see her again  But I must not propose it yet  My uncle has been too good for me to encroach  I must still add to this long letter  You have not heard all that you ought to hear  I could not give any connected detail yesterday  but the suddenness  and  in one light  the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out  needs explanation  for though the event of the th ult  as you will conclude  immediately opened to me the happiest prospects  I should not have presumed on such early measures  but from the very particular circumstances  which left me not an hour to lose  I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty  and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement  But I had no choice  The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman  Here  my dear madam  I was obliged to leave off abruptly  to recollect and compose myself  I have been walking over the country  and am now  I hope  rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be  It is  in fact  a most mortifying retrospect for me  I behaved shamefully  And here I can admit  that my manners to Miss W  in being unpleasant to Miss F  were highly blameable  _She_ disapproved them  which ought to have been enough  My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient  She was displeased  I thought unreasonably so  I thought her  on a thousand occasions  unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious  I thought her even cold  But she was always right  If I had followed her judgment  and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper  I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known  We quarrelled  Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell  _There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis  I was late  I met her walking home by herself  and wanted to walk with her  but she would not suffer it  She absolutely refused to allow me  which I then thought most unreasonable  Now  however  I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion  While I  to blind the world to our engagement  was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman  was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless  Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury  the truth must have been suspected  I was mad enough  however  to resent  I doubted her affection  I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill  when  provoked by such conduct on my side  such shameful  insolent neglect of her  and such apparent devotion to Miss W  as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure  she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me  In short  my dear madam  it was a quarrel blameless on her side  abominable on mine  and I returned the same evening to Richmond  though I might have staid with you till the next morning  merely because I would be as angry with her as possible  Even then  I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time  but I was the injured person  injured by her coldness  and I went away determined that she should make the first advances  I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party  Had you witnessed my behaviour there  I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again  Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced  as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls  she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs  Elton  the whole system of whose treatment of her  by the bye  has ever filled me with indignation and hatred  I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself  but  otherwise  I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known  ` Jane  indeed  You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name  even to you  Think  then  what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition  and all the insolence of imaginary superiority  Have patience with me  I shall soon have done  She closed with this offer  resolving to break with me entirely  and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again  _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_  _she_ _dissolved_ _it_  This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt  s death  I answered it within an hour  but from the confusion of my mind  and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once  my answer  instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day  was locked up in my writing  desk  and I  trusting that I had written enough  though but a few lines  to satisfy her  remained without any uneasiness  I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily  but I made excuses for her  and was too busy  and  may I add  too cheerful in my views to be captious  We removed to Windsor  and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her  my own letters all returned  and a few lines at the same time by the post  stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last  and adding  that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued  and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible  she now sent me  by a safe conveyance  all my letters  and requested  that if I could not directly command hers  so as to send them to Highbury within a week  I would forward them after that period to her at  in short  the full direction to Mr  Smallridge  s  near Bristol  stared me in the face  I knew the name  the place  I knew all about it  and instantly saw what she had been doing  It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess  and the secrecy she had maintained  as to any such design in her former letter  was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy  For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me  Imagine the shock  imagine how  till I had actually detected my own blunder  I raved at the blunders of the post  What was to be done  One thing only  I must speak to my uncle  Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again  I spoke  circumstances were in my favour  the late event had softened away his pride  and he was  earlier than I could have anticipated  wholly reconciled and complying  and could say at last  poor man  with a deep sigh  that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done  I felt that it would be of a different sort  Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him  for my suspense while all was at stake  No  do not pity me till I reached Highbury  and saw how ill I had made her  Do not pity me till I saw her wan  sick looks  I reached Highbury at the time of day when  from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour  I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone  I was not disappointed  and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey  A great deal of very reasonable  very just displeasure I had to persuade away  But it is done  we are reconciled  dearer  much dearer  than ever  and no moment  s uneasiness can ever occur between us again  Now  my dear madam  I will release you  but I could not conclude before  A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me  and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her  If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve  I am quite of your opinion  Miss W  calls me the child of good fortune  I hope she is right  In one respect  my good fortune is undoubted  that of being able to subscribe myself  Your obliged and affectionate Son  F  C  WESTON CHURCHILL  CHAPTER XV This letter must make its way to Emma  s feelings  She was obliged  in spite of her previous determination to the contrary  to do it all the justice that Mrs  Weston foretold  As soon as she came to her own name  it was irresistible  every line relating to herself was interesting  and almost every line agreeable  and when this charm ceased  the subject could still maintain itself  by the natural return of her former regard for the writer  and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment  She never stopt till she had gone through the whole  and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong  yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed  and he had suffered  and was very sorry  and he was so grateful to Mrs  Weston  and so much in love with Miss Fairfax  and she was so happy herself  that there was no being severe  and could he have entered the room  she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever  She thought so well of the letter  that when Mr  Knightley came again  she desired him to read it  She was sure of Mrs  Weston  s wishing it to be communicated  especially to one  who  like Mr  Knightley  had seen so much to blame in his conduct   I shall be very glad to look it over  said he   but it seems long  I will take it home with me at night  But that would not do  Mr  Weston was to call in the evening  and she must return it by him   I would rather be talking to you  he replied   but as it seems a matter of justice  it shall be done  He began  stopping  however  almost directly to say   Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman  s letters to his mother  in  law a few months ago  Emma  it would not have been taken with such indifference  He proceeded a little farther  reading to himself  and then  with a smile  observed   Humph  a fine complimentary opening  But it is his way  One man  s style must not be the rule of another  s  We will not be severe   It will be natural for me  he added shortly afterwards   to speak my opinion aloud as I read  By doing it  I shall feel that I am near you  It will not be so great a loss of time  but if you dislike it   Not at all  I should wish it  Mr  Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity   He trifles here  said he   as to the temptation  He knows he is wrong  and has nothing rational to urge  Bad  He ought not to have formed the engagement ` His father  s disposition  he is unjust  however  to his father  Mr  Weston  s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions  but Mr  Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it  Very true  he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here   And I have not forgotten  said Emma   how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would  You pass it over very handsomely  but you were perfectly right   I was not quite impartial in my judgment  Emma  but yet  I think  had _you_ not been in the case  I should still have distrusted him  When he came to Miss Woodhouse  he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud  all that related to her  with a smile  a look  a shake of the head  a word or two of assent  or disapprobation  or merely of love  as the subject required  concluding  however  seriously  and  after steady reflection  thus   Very bad  though it might have been worse  Playing a most dangerous game  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal  No judge of his own manners by you  Always deceived in fact by his own wishes  and regardless of little besides his own convenience  Fancying you to have fathomed his secret  Natural enough  his own mind full of intrigue  that he should suspect it in others  Mystery  Finesse  how they pervert the understanding  My Emma  does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other  Emma agreed to it  and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet  s account  which she could not give any sincere explanation of   You had better go on  said she  He did so  but very soon stopt again to say   the pianoforte  Ah  That was the act of a very  very young man  one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure  A boyish scheme  indeed  I cannot comprehend a man  s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with  and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument  s coming if she could  After this  he made some progress without any pause  Frank Churchill  s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing   I perfectly agree with you  sir  was then his remark   You did behave very shamefully  You never wrote a truer line  And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement  and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax  s sense of right  he made a fuller pause to say   This is very bad  He had induced her to place herself  for his sake  in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness  and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily  She must have had much more to contend with  in carrying on the correspondence  than he could  He should have respected even unreasonable scruples  had there been such  but hers were all reasonable  We must look to her one fault  and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement  to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment  Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party  and grew uncomfortable  Her own behaviour had been so very improper  She was deeply ashamed  and a little afraid of his next look  It was all read  however  steadily  attentively  and without the smallest remark  and  excepting one momentary glance at her  instantly withdrawn  in the fear of giving pain  no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist   There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends  the Eltons  was his next observation  His feelings are natural  What  actually resolve to break with him entirely  She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each  she dissolved it  What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour  Well  he must be a most extraordinary   Nay  nay  read on  You will find how very much he suffers   I hope he does  replied Mr  Knightley coolly  and resuming the letter  ` Smallridge  What does this mean  What is all this   She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs  Smallridge  s children  a dear friend of Mrs  Elton  s  a neighbour of Maple Grove  and  by the bye  I wonder how Mrs  Elton bears the disappointment   Say nothing  my dear Emma  while you oblige me to read  not even of Mrs  Elton  Only one page more  I shall soon have done  What a letter the man writes   I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him   Well  there _is_ feeling here  He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill  Certainly  I can have no doubt of his being fond of her  ` Dearer  much dearer than ever  I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation  He is a very liberal thanker  with his thousands and tens of thousands ` Happier than I deserve  Come  he knows himself there  ` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune  Those were Miss Woodhouse  s words  were they  And a fine ending  and there is the letter  The child of good fortune  That was your name for him  was it   You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am  but still you must  at least I hope you must  think the better of him for it  I hope it does him some service with you   Yes  certainly it does  He has had great faults  faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness  and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves  but still as he is  beyond a doubt  really attached to Miss Fairfax  and will soon  it may be hoped  have the advantage of being constantly with her  I am very ready to believe his character will improve  and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants  And now  let me talk to you of something else  I have another person  s interest at present so much at heart  that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill  Ever since I left you this morning  Emma  my mind has been hard at work on one subject  The subject followed  it was in plain  unaffected  gentlemanlike English  such as Mr  Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with  how to be able to ask her to marry him  without attacking the happiness of her father  Emma  s answer was ready at the first word   While her dear father lived  any change of condition must be impossible for her  She could never quit him  Part only of this answer  however  was admitted  The impossibility of her quitting her father  Mr  Knightley felt as strongly as herself  but the inadmissibility of any other change  he could not agree to  He had been thinking it over most deeply  most intently  he had at first hoped to induce Mr  Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell  he had wanted to believe it feasible  but his knowledge of Mr  Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long  and now he confessed his persuasion  that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father  s comfort  perhaps even of his life  which must not be hazarded  Mr  Woodhouse taken from Hartfield  No  he felt that it ought not to be attempted  But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this  he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable  it was  that he should be received at Hartfield  that so long as her father  s happiness in other words his life  required Hartfield to continue her home  it should be his likewise  Of their all removing to Donwell  Emma had already had her own passing thoughts  Like him  she had tried the scheme and rejected it  but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her  She was sensible of all the affection it evinced  She felt that  in quitting Donwell  he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits  that in living constantly with her father  and in no house of his own  there would be much  very much  to be borne with  She promised to think of it  and advised him to think of it more  but he was fully convinced  that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject  He had given it  he could assure her  very long and calm consideration  he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning  to have his thoughts to himself   Ah  there is one difficulty unprovided for  cried Emma   I am sure William Larkins will not like it  You must get his consent before you ask mine  She promised  however  to think of it  and pretty nearly promised  moreover  to think of it  with the intention of finding it a very good scheme  It is remarkable  that Emma  in the many  very many  points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey  was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry  whose rights as heir  expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded  Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy  and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it  and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr  Knightley  s marrying Jane Fairfax  or any body else  which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt  This proposal of his  this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield  the more she contemplated it  the more pleasing it became  His evils seemed to lessen  her own advantages to increase  their mutual good to outweigh every drawback  Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her  Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy  She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet  but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend  who must now be even excluded from Hartfield  The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself  poor Harriet must  in mere charitable caution  be kept at a distance from  She would be a loser in every way  Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment  In such a party  Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise  but for the poor girl herself  it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment  In time  of course  Mr  Knightley would be forgotten  that is  supplanted  but this could not be expected to happen very early  Mr  Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure  not like Mr  Elton  Mr  Knightley  always so kind  so feeling  so truly considerate for every body  would never deserve to be less worshipped than now  and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet  that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year  CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting  Their intercourse was painful enough by letter  How much worse  had they been obliged to meet  Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed  without reproaches  or apparent sense of ill  usage  and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment  a something bordering on it in her style  which increased the desirableness of their being separate  It might be only her own consciousness  but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke  She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella  s invitation  and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it  without resorting to invention  There was a tooth amiss  Harriet really wished  and had wished some time  to consult a dentist  Mrs  John Knightley was delighted to be of use  any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her  and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr  Wingfield  she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care  When it was thus settled on her sister  s side  Emma proposed it to her friend  and found her very persuadable  Harriet was to go  she was invited for at least a fortnight  she was to be conveyed in Mr  Woodhouse  s carriage  It was all arranged  it was all completed  and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square  Now Emma could  indeed  enjoy Mr  Knightley  s visits  now she could talk  and she could listen with true happiness  unchecked by that sense of injustice  of guilt  of something most painful  which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her  how much might at that moment  and at a little distance  be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself  The difference of Harriet at Mrs  Goddard  s  or in London  made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma  s sensations  but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment  which must be averting the past  and carrying her out of herself  She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied  There was a communication before her  one which _she_ only could be competent to make  the confession of her engagement to her father  but she would have nothing to do with it at present  She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs  Weston were safe and well  No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved  and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time  A fortnight  at least  of leisure and peace of mind  to crown every warmer  but more agitating  delight  should be hers  She soon resolved  equally as a duty and a pleasure  to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax  She ought to go  and she was longing to see her  the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill  It would be a _secret_ satisfaction  but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate  She went  she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door  but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill  when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion  though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected  The fear of being still unwelcome  determined her  though assured of their being at home  to wait in the passage  and send up her name  She heard Patty announcing it  but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible  No  she heard nothing but the instant reply of   Beg her to walk up  and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself  coming eagerly forward  as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient  Emma had never seen her look so well  so lovely  so engaging  There was consciousness  animation  and warmth  there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted  She came forward with an offered hand  and said  in a low  but very feeling tone   This is most kind  indeed  Miss Woodhouse  it is impossible for me to express  I hope you will believe  Excuse me for being so entirely without words  Emma was gratified  and would soon have shewn no want of words  if the sound of Mrs  Elton  s voice from the sitting  room had not checked her  and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very  very earnest shake of the hand  Mrs  Bates and Mrs  Elton were together  Miss Bates was out  which accounted for the previous tranquillity  Emma could have wished Mrs  Elton elsewhere  but she was in a humour to have patience with every body  and as Mrs  Elton met her with unusual graciousness  she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm  She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs  Elton  s thoughts  and understand why she was  like herself  in happy spirits  it was being in Miss Fairfax  s confidence  and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people  Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face  and while paying her own compliments to Mrs  Bates  and appearing to attend to the good old lady  s replies  she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax  and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side  saying  with significant nods   We can finish this some other time  you know  You and I shall not want opportunities  And  in fact  you have heard all the essential already  I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs  S  admits our apology  and is not offended  You see how delightfully she writes  Oh  she is a sweet creature  You would have doated on her  had you gone  But not a word more  Let us be discreet  quite on our good behaviour  Hush  You remember those lines  I forget the poem at this moment   For when a lady  s in the case   You know all other things give place  Now I say  my dear  in _our_ case  for _lady_  read  mum  a word to the wise  I am in a fine flow of spirits  an  t I  But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs  S  _My_ representation  you see  has quite appeased her  And again  on Emma  s merely turning her head to look at Mrs  Bates  s knitting  she added  in a half whisper   I mentioned no _names_  you will observe  Oh  no  cautious as a minister of state  I managed it extremely well  Emma could not doubt  It was a palpable display  repeated on every possible occasion  When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs  Weston  she found herself abruptly addressed with   Do not you think  Miss Woodhouse  our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered  Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit  here was a side  glance of great meaning at Jane  Upon my word  Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time  Oh  if you had seen her  as I did  when she was at the worst  And when Mrs  Bates was saying something to Emma  whispered farther   We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have  not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor  Oh  no  Perry shall have all the credit   I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you  Miss Woodhouse  she shortly afterwards began   since the party to Box Hill  Very pleasant party  But yet I think there was something wanting  Things did not seem  that is  there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some  So it appeared to me at least  but I might be mistaken  However  I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again  What say you both to our collecting the same party  and exploring to Box Hill again  while the fine weather lasts  It must be the same party  you know  quite the same party  not _one_ exception  Soon after this Miss Bates came in  and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself  resulting  she supposed  from doubt of what might be said  and impatience to say every thing   Thank you  dear Miss Woodhouse  you are all kindness  It is impossible to say  Yes  indeed  I quite understand  dearest Jane  s prospects  that is  I do not mean  But she is charmingly recovered  How is Mr  Woodhouse  I am so glad  Quite out of my power  Such a happy little circle as you find us here  Yes  indeed  Charming young man  that is  so very friendly  I mean good Mr  Perry  such attention to Jane  And from her great  her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs  Elton for being there  Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane  from the vicarage quarter  which was now graciously overcome  After a few whispers  indeed  which placed it beyond a guess  Mrs  Elton  speaking louder  said   Yes  here I am  my good friend  and here I have been so long  that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise  but  the truth is  that I am waiting for my lord and master  He promised to join me here  and pay his respects to you   What  are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr  Elton  That will be a favour indeed  for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits  and Mr  Elton  s time is so engaged   Upon my word it is  Miss Bates  He really is engaged from morning to night  There is no end of people  s coming to him  on some pretence or other  The magistrates  and overseers  and churchwardens  are always wanting his opinion  They seem not able to do any thing without him ` Upon my word  Mr  E  I often say  ` rather you than I  I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument  if I had half so many applicants  Bad enough as it is  for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree  I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight  However  he is coming  I assure you  yes  indeed  on purpose to wait on you all  And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma  A congratulatory visit  you know  Oh  yes  quite indispensable  Miss Bates looked about her  so happily   He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley  but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation  Mr  E  is Knightley  s right hand  Emma would not have smiled for the world  and only said   Is Mr  Elton gone on foot to Donwell  He will have a hot walk   Oh  no  it is a meeting at the Crown  a regular meeting  Weston and Cole will be there too  but one is apt to speak only of those who lead  I fancy Mr  E  and Knightley have every thing their own way   Have not you mistaken the day  said Emma   I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to  morrow  Mr  Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday  and spoke of it as for Saturday   Oh  no  the meeting is certainly to  day  was the abrupt answer  which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs  Elton  s side   I do believe  she continued   this is the most troublesome parish that ever was  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove   Your parish there was small  said Jane   Upon my word  my dear  I do not know  for I never heard the subject talked of   But it is proved by the smallness of the school  which I have heard you speak of  as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs  Bragge  the only school  and not more than five  and  twenty children   Ah  you clever creature  that  s very true  What a thinking brain you have  I say  Jane  what a perfect character you and I should make  if we could be shaken together  My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection  Not that I presume to insinuate  however  that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already  But hush  not a word  if you please  It seemed an unnecessary caution  Jane was wanting to give her words  not to Mrs  Elton  but to Miss Woodhouse  as the latter plainly saw  The wish of distinguishing her  as far as civility permitted  was very evident  though it could not often proceed beyond a look  Mr  Elton made his appearance  His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity   Very pretty  sir  upon my word  to send me on here  to be an encumbrance to my friends  so long before you vouchsafe to come  But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with  You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared  Here have I been sitting this hour  giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience  for who can say  you know  how soon it may be wanted  Mr  Elton was so hot and tired  that all this wit seemed thrown away  His civilities to the other ladies must be paid  but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering  and the walk he had had for nothing   When I got to Donwell  said he   Knightley could not be found  Very odd  very unaccountable  after the note I sent him this morning  and the message he returned  that he should certainly be at home till one   Donwell  cried his wife  My dear Mr  E  you have not been to Donwell  You mean the Crown  you come from the meeting at the Crown   No  no  that  s to  morrow  and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to  day on that very account  Such a dreadful broiling morning  I went over the fields too  speaking in a tone of great ill  usage  which made it so much the worse  And then not to find him at home  I assure you I am not at all pleased  And no apology left  no message for me  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected  Very extraordinary  And nobody knew at all which way he was gone  Perhaps to Hartfield  perhaps to the Abbey Mill  perhaps into his woods  Miss Woodhouse  this is not like our friend Knightley  Can you explain it  Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary  indeed  and that she had not a syllable to say for him   I cannot imagine  said Mrs  Elton   feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do   I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you  of all people in the world  The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten  My dear Mr  E  he must have left a message for you  I am sure he must  Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric  and his servants forgot it  Depend upon it  that was the case  and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants  who are all  I have often observed  extremely awkward and remiss  I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration  And as for Mrs  Hodges  Wright holds her very cheap indeed  She promised Wright a receipt  and never sent it   I met William Larkins  continued Mr  Elton   as I got near the house  and he told me I should not find his master at home  but I did not believe him  William seemed rather out of humour  He did not know what was come to his master lately  he said  but he could hardly ever get the speech of him  I have nothing to do with William  s wants  but it really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to  day  and it becomes a matter  therefore  of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose  Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly  In all probability she was at this very time waited for there  and Mr  Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr  Elton  if not towards William Larkins  She was pleased  on taking leave  to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room  to go with her even downstairs  it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of  to say   It is as well  perhaps  that I have not had the possibility  Had you not been surrounded by other friends  I might have been tempted to introduce a subject  to ask questions  to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct  I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent   Oh  cried Jane  with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure  there would have been no danger  The danger would have been of my wearying you  You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest  Indeed  Miss Woodhouse   speaking more collectedly  with the consciousness which I have of misconduct  very great misconduct  it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends  whose good opinion is most worth preserving  are not disgusted to such a degree as to  I have not time for half that I could wish to say  I long to make apologies  excuses  to urge something for myself  I feel it so very due  But  unfortunately  in short  if your compassion does not stand my friend   Oh  you are too scrupulous  indeed you are  cried Emma warmly  and taking her hand   You owe me no apologies  and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them  is so perfectly satisfied  so delighted even   You are very kind  but I know what my manners were to you  So cold and artificial  I had always a part to act  It was a life of deceit  I know that I must have disgusted you   Pray say no more  I feel that all the apologies should be on my side  Let us forgive each other at once  We must do whatever is to be done quickest  and I think our feelings will lose no time there  I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor   Very   And the next news  I suppose  will be  that we are to lose you  just as I begin to know you   Oh  as to all that  of course nothing can be thought of yet  I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs  Campbell   Nothing can be actually settled yet  perhaps  replied Emma  smiling  but  excuse me  it must be thought of  The smile was returned as Jane answered   You are very right  it has been thought of  And I will own to you   I am sure it will be safe  that so far as our living with Mr  Churchill at Enscombe  it is settled  There must be three months  at least  of deep mourning  but when they are over  I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for   Thank you  thank you  This is just what I wanted to be assured of  Oh  if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open  Good  bye  good  bye  CHAPTER XVII Mrs  Weston  s friends were all made happy by her safety  and if the satisfaction of her well  doing could be increased to Emma  it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl  She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston  She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her  hereafter  with either of Isabella  s sons  but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best  It would be a great comfort to Mr  Weston  as he grew older  and even Mr  Weston might be growing older ten years hence  to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense  the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home  and Mrs  Weston  no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her  and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach  should not have their powers in exercise again   She has had the advantage  you know  of practising on me  she continued  like La Baronne d  Almane on La Comtesse d  Ostalis  in Madame de Genlis  Adelaide and Theodore  and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan   That is  replied Mr  Knightley   she will indulge her even more than she did you  and believe that she does not indulge her at all  It will be the only difference   Poor child  cried Emma   at that rate  what will become of her   Nothing very bad  The fate of thousands  She will be disagreeable in infancy  and correct herself as she grows older  I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children  my dearest Emma  I  who am owing all my happiness to _you_  would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them  Emma laughed  and replied   But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people  I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it   Do you  I have no doubt  Nature gave you understanding  Miss Taylor gave you principles  You must have done well  My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good  It was very natural for you to say  what right has he to lecture me  and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner  I do not believe I did you any good  The good was all to myself  by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me  I could not think about you so much without doating on you  faults and all  and by dint of fancying so many errors  have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least   I am sure you were of use to me  cried Emma   I was very often influenced rightly by you  oftener than I would own at the time  I am very sure you did me good  And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled  it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me  except falling in love with her when she is thirteen   How often  when you were a girl  have you said to me  with one of your saucy looks ` Mr  Knightley  I am going to do so  and  so  papa says I may  or I have Miss Taylor  s leave  something which  you knew  I did not approve  In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one   What an amiable creature I was  No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance  ` Mr  Knightley  You always called me  ` Mr  Knightley  and  from habit  it has not so very formal a sound  And yet it is formal  I want you to call me something else  but I do not know what   I remember once calling you ` George  in one of my amiable fits  about ten years ago  I did it because I thought it would offend you  but  as you made no objection  I never did it again   And cannot you call me ` George  now   Impossible  I never can call you any thing but ` Mr  Knightley  I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs  Elton  by calling you Mr  K  But I will promise  she added presently  laughing and blushing  I will promise to call you once by your Christian name  I do not say when  but perhaps you may guess where  in the building in which N  takes M  for better  for worse  Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her  to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies  her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith  but it was too tender a subject  She could not enter on it  Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them  This  on his side  might merely proceed from her not being thought of  but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy  and a suspicion  from some appearances  that their friendship were declining  She was aware herself  that  parting under any other circumstances  they certainly should have corresponded more  and that her intelligence would not have rested  as it now almost wholly did  on Isabella  s letters  He might observe that it was so  The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him  was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy  Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected  on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits  which appeared perfectly natural  as there was a dentist to be consulted  but  since that business had been over  she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before  Isabella  to be sure  was no very quick observer  yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children  it would not have escaped her  Emma  s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on  by Harriet  s being to stay longer  her fortnight was likely to be a month at least  Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley were to come down in August  and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back   John does not even mention your friend  said Mr  Knightley   Here is his answer  if you like to see it  It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage  Emma accepted it with a very eager hand  with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it  and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned   John enters like a brother into my happiness  continued Mr  Knightley   but he is no complimenter  and though I well know him to have  likewise  a most brotherly affection for you  he is so far from making flourishes  that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes   He writes like a sensible man  replied Emma  when she had read the letter   I honour his sincerity  It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side  but that he is not without hope of my growing  in time  as worthy of your affection  as you think me already  Had he said any thing to bear a different construction  I should not have believed him   My Emma  he means no such thing  He only means   He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two  interrupted she  with a sort of serious smile  much less  perhaps  than he is aware of  if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject   Emma  my dear Emma   Oh  she cried with more thorough gaiety   if you fancy your brother does not do me justice  only wait till my dear father is in the secret  and hear his opinion  Depend upon it  he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice  He will think all the happiness  all the advantage  on your side of the question  all the merit on mine  I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma  with him at once  His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther   Ah  he cried   I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be  of our having every right that equal worth can give  to be happy together  I am amused by one part of John  s letter  did you notice it  where he says  that my information did not take him wholly by surprize  that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind   If I understand your brother  he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying  He had no idea of me  He seems perfectly unprepared for that   Yes  yes  but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings  What has he been judging by  I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another  But it was so  I suppose  I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day  I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual  I remember one evening the poor boys saying  ` Uncle seems always tired now  The time was coming when the news must spread farther  and other persons  reception of it tried  As soon as Mrs  Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr  Woodhouse  s visits  Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause  resolved first to announce it at home  and then at Randalls  But how to break it to her father at last  She had bound herself to do it  in such an hour of Mr  Knightley  s absence  or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her  and she must have put it off  but Mr  Knightley was to come at such a time  and follow up the beginning she was to make  She was forced to speak  and to speak cheerfully too  She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him  by a melancholy tone herself  She must not appear to think it a misfortune  With all the spirits she could command  she prepared him first for something strange  and then  in a few words  said  that if his consent and approbation could be obtained  which  she trusted  would be attended with no difficulty  since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all  she and Mr  Knightley meant to marry  by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person  s company whom she knew he loved  next to his daughters and Mrs  Weston  best in the world  Poor man  it was at first a considerable shock to him  and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it  She was reminded  more than once  of having always said she would never marry  and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single  and told of poor Isabella  and poor Miss Taylor  But it would not do  Emma hung about him affectionately  and smiled  and said it must be so  and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs  Weston  whose marriages taking them from Hartfield  had  indeed  made a melancholy change  but she was not going from Hartfield  she should be always there  she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better  and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr  Knightley always at hand  when he were once got used to the idea  Did he not love Mr  Knightley very much  He would not deny that he did  she was sure  Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr  Knightley  Who was so useful to him  who so ready to write his letters  who so glad to assist him  Who so cheerful  so attentive  so attached to him  Would not he like to have him always on the spot  Yes  That was all very true  Mr  Knightley could not be there too often  he should be glad to see him every day  but they did see him every day as it was  Why could not they go on as they had done  Mr  Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled  but the worst was overcome  the idea was given  time and continual repetition must do the rest  To Emma  s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr  Knightley  s  whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome  and he was soon used to be talked to by each  on every fair occasion  They had all the assistance which Isabella could give  by letters of the strongest approbation  and Mrs  Weston was ready  on the first meeting  to consider the subject in the most serviceable light  first  as a settled  and  secondly  as a good one  well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr  Woodhouse  s mind  It was agreed upon  as what was to be  and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness  and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it  he began to think that some time or other  in another year or two  perhaps  it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place  Mrs  Weston was acting no part  feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event  She had been extremely surprized  never more so  than when Emma first opened the affair to her  but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all  and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost  She had such a regard for Mr  Knightley  as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma  and it was in every respect so proper  suitable  and unexceptionable a connexion  and in one respect  one point of the highest importance  so peculiarly eligible  so singularly fortunate  that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature  and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it  and wished it long ago  How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield  And who but Mr  Knightley could know and bear with Mr  Woodhouse  so as to make such an arrangement desirable  The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr  Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband  s plans and her own  for a marriage between Frank and Emma  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment  less acknowledged by Mr  Weston than by herself  but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying  Those matters will take care of themselves  the young people will find a way  But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future  It was all right  all open  all equal  No sacrifice on any side worth the name  It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself  and without one real  rational difficulty to oppose or delay it  Mrs  Weston  with her baby on her knee  indulging in such reflections as these  was one of the happiest women in the world  If any thing could increase her delight  it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps  The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread  and Mr  Weston had his five minutes share of it  but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind  He saw the advantages of the match  and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife  but the wonder of it was very soon nothing  and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it   It is to be a secret  I conclude  said he   These matters are always a secret  till it is found out that every body knows them  Only let me be told when I may speak out  I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion  He went to Highbury the next morning  and satisfied himself on that point  He told her the news  Was not she like a daughter  his eldest daughter  he must tell her  and Miss Bates being present  it passed  of course  to Mrs  Cole  Mrs  Perry  and Mrs  Elton  immediately afterwards  It was no more than the principals were prepared for  they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls  how soon it would be over Highbury  and were thinking of themselves  as the evening wonder in many a family circle  with great sagacity  In general  it was a very well approved match  Some might think him  and others might think her  the most in luck  One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell  and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys  and another might predict disagreements among their servants  but yet  upon the whole  there was no serious objection raised  except in one habitation  the Vicarage  There  the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction  Mr  Elton cared little about it  compared with his wife  he only hoped  the young lady  s pride would now be contented  and supposed  she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could  and  on the point of living at Hartfield  could daringly exclaim   Rather he than I  But Mrs  Elton was very much discomposed indeed  Poor Knightley  poor fellow  sad business for him  She was extremely concerned  for  though very eccentric  he had a thousand good qualities  How could he be so taken in  Did not think him at all in love  not in the least  Poor Knightley  There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him  How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him  But that would be all over now  Poor fellow  No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_  Oh  no  there would be a Mrs  Knightley to throw cold water on every thing  Extremely disagreeable  But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day  Shocking plan  living together  It would never do  She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it  and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter  CHAPTER XVIII Time passed on  A few more to  morrows  and the party from London would be arriving  It was an alarming change  and Emma was thinking of it one morning  as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her  when Mr  Knightley came in  and distressing thoughts were put by  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent  and then  in a graver tone  began with   I have something to tell you  Emma  some news   Good or bad  said she  quickly  looking up in his face   I do not know which it ought to be called   Oh  good I am sure  I see it in your countenance  You are trying not to smile   I am afraid  said he  composing his features   I am very much afraid  my dear Emma  that you will not smile when you hear it   Indeed  but why so  I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you  should not please and amuse me too   There is one subject  he replied   I hope but one  on which we do not think alike  He paused a moment  again smiling  with his eyes fixed on her face   Does nothing occur to you  Do not you recollect  Harriet Smith  Her cheeks flushed at the name  and she felt afraid of something  though she knew not what   Have you heard from her yourself this morning  cried he   You have  I believe  and know the whole   No  I have not  I know nothing  pray tell me   You are prepared for the worst  I see  and very bad it is  Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin  Emma gave a start  which did not seem like being prepared  and her eyes  in eager gaze  said   No  this is impossible  but her lips were closed   It is so  indeed  continued Mr  Knightley   I have it from Robert Martin himself  He left me not half an hour ago  She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement   You like it  my Emma  as little as I feared  I wish our opinions were the same  But in time they will  Time  you may be sure  will make one or the other of us think differently  and  in the meanwhile  we need not talk much on the subject   You mistake me  you quite mistake me  she replied  exerting herself   It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy  but I cannot believe it  It seems an impossibility  You cannot mean to say  that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin  You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again  yet  You only mean  that he intends it   I mean that he has done it  answered Mr  Knightley  with smiling but determined decision   and been accepted   Good God  she cried  Well  Then having recourse to her workbasket  in excuse for leaning down her face  and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing  she added   Well  now tell me every thing  make this intelligible to me  How  where  when  Let me know it all  I never was more surprized  but it does not make me unhappy  I assure you  How  how has it been possible   It is a very simple story  He went to town on business three days ago  and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John  He delivered these papers to John  at his chambers  and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley  s  They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley  s  The party was to be our brother and sister  Henry  John  and Miss Smith  My friend Robert could not resist  They called for him in their way  were all extremely amused  and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day  which he did  and in the course of that visit  as I understand  he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet  and certainly did not speak in vain  She made him  by her acceptance  as happy even as he is deserving  He came down by yesterday  s coach  and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast  to report his proceedings  first on my affairs  and then on his own  This is all that I can relate of the how  where  and when  Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her  She will give you all the minute particulars  which only woman  s language can make interesting  In our communications we deal only in the great  However  I must say  that Robert Martin  s heart seemed for _him_  and to _me_  very overflowing  and that he did mention  without its being much to the purpose  that on quitting their box at Astley  s  my brother took charge of Mrs  John Knightley and little John  and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry  and that at one time they were in such a crowd  as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy  He stopped  Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply  To speak  she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness  She must wait a moment  or he would think her mad  Her silence disturbed him  and after observing her a little while  he added   Emma  my love  you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy  but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected  His situation is an evil  but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend  and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more  His good sense and good principles would delight you  As far as the man is concerned  you could not wish your friend in better hands  His rank in society I would alter if I could  which is saying a great deal I assure you  Emma  You laugh at me about William Larkins  but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin  He wanted her to look up and smile  and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly  she did  cheerfully answering   You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match  I think Harriet is doing extremely well  _Her_ connexions may be worse than _his_  In respectability of character  there can be no doubt that they are  I have been silent from surprize merely  excessive surprize  You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me  how peculiarly unprepared I was  for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him  much more  than she was before   You ought to know your friend best  replied Mr  Knightley   but I should say she was a good  tempered  soft  hearted girl  not likely to be very  very determined against any young man who told her he loved her  Emma could not help laughing as she answered   Upon my word  I believe you know her quite as well as I do  But  Mr  Knightley  are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him  I could suppose she might in time  but can she already  Did not you misunderstand him  You were both talking of other things  of business  shows of cattle  or new drills  and might not you  in the confusion of so many subjects  mistake him  It was not Harriet  s hand that he was certain of  it was the dimensions of some famous ox  The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr  Knightley and Robert Martin was  at this moment  so strong to Emma  s feelings  and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet  s side  so fresh the sound of those words  spoken with such emphasis   No  I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin  that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove  in some measure  premature  It could not be otherwise   Do you dare say this  cried Mr  Knightley   Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead  as not to know what a man is talking of  What do you deserve   Oh  I always deserve the best treatment  because I never put up with any other  and  therefore  you must give me a plain  direct answer  Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr  Martin and Harriet now are   I am quite sure  he replied  speaking very distinctly   that he told me she had accepted him  and that there was no obscurity  nothing doubtful  in the words he used  and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so  He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do  He knew of no one but Mrs  Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends  Could I mention any thing more fit to be done  than to go to Mrs  Goddard  I assured him that I could not  Then  he said  he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day   I am perfectly satisfied  replied Emma  with the brightest smiles   and most sincerely wish them happy   You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before   I hope so  for at that time I was a fool   And I am changed also  for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet  s good qualities  I have taken some pains for your sake  and for Robert Martin  s sake   whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever  to get acquainted with her  I have often talked to her a good deal  You must have seen that I did  Sometimes  indeed  I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin  s cause  which was never the case  but  from all my observations  I am convinced of her being an artless  amiable girl  with very good notions  very seriously good principles  and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life  Much of this  I have no doubt  she may thank you for   Me  cried Emma  shaking her head  Ah  poor Harriet  She checked herself  however  and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved  Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father  She was not sorry  She wanted to be alone  Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder  which made it impossible for her to be collected  She was in dancing  singing  exclaiming spirits  and till she had moved about  and talked to herself  and laughed and reflected  she could be fit for nothing rational  Her father  s business was to announce James  s being gone out to put the horses to  preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls  and she had  therefore  an immediate excuse for disappearing  The joy  the gratitude  the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet  s welfare  she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security  What had she to wish for  Nothing  but to grow more worthy of him  whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own  Nothing  but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future  Serious she was  very serious in her thankfulness  and in her resolutions  and yet there was no preventing a laugh  sometimes in the very midst of them  She must laugh at such a close  Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back  Such a heart  such a Harriet  Now there would be pleasure in her returning  Every thing would be a pleasure  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin  High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities  was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr  Knightley would soon be over  The disguise  equivocation  mystery  so hateful to her to practise  might soon be over  She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty  In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father  not always listening  but always agreeing to what he said  and  whether in speech or silence  conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day  or poor Mrs  Weston would be disappointed  They arrived  Mrs  Weston was alone in the drawing  room  but hardly had they been told of the baby  and Mr  Woodhouse received the thanks for coming  which he asked for  when a glimpse was caught through the blind  of two figures passing near the window   It is Frank and Miss Fairfax  said Mrs  Weston   I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning  He stays till to  morrow  and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us  They are coming in  I hope  In half a minute they were in the room  Emma was extremely glad to see him  but there was a degree of confusion  a number of embarrassing recollections on each side  They met readily and smiling  but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said  and having all sat down again  there was for some time such a blank in the circle  that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged  which she had long felt  of seeing Frank Churchill once more  and of seeing him with Jane  would yield its proportion of pleasure  When Mr  Weston joined the party  however  and when the baby was fetched  there was no longer a want of subject or animation  or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say   I have to thank you  Miss Woodhouse  for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs  Weston  s letters  I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon  I hope you do not retract what you then said   No  indeed  cried Emma  most happy to begin   not in the least  I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you  and to give you joy in person  He thanked her with all his heart  and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness   Is not she looking well  said he  turning his eyes towards Jane   Better than she ever used to do  You see how my father and Mrs  Weston doat upon her  But his spirits were soon rising again  and with laughing eyes  after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells  he named the name of Dixon  Emma blushed  and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing   I can never think of it  she cried   without extreme shame   The shame  he answered   is all mine  or ought to be  But is it possible that you had no suspicion  I mean of late  Early  I know  you had none   I never had the smallest  I assure you   That appears quite wonderful  I was once very near  and I wish I had  it would have been better  But though I was always doing wrong things  they were very bad wrong things  and such as did me no service  It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing   It is not now worth a regret  said Emma   I have some hope  resumed he   of my uncle  s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls  he wants to be introduced to her  When the Campbells are returned  we shall meet them in London  and continue there  I trust  till we may carry her northward  But now  I am at such a distance from her  is not it hard  Miss Woodhouse  Till this morning  we have not once met since the day of reconciliation  Do not you pity me  Emma spoke her pity so very kindly  that with a sudden accession of gay thought  he cried   Ah  by the bye  then sinking his voice  and looking demure for the moment  I hope Mr  Knightley is well  He paused  She coloured and laughed  I know you saw my letter  and think you may remember my wish in your favour  Let me return your congratulations  I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction  He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise  Emma was delighted  and only wanted him to go on in the same style  but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane  and his next words were   Did you ever see such a skin  such smoothness  such delicacy  and yet without being actually fair  One cannot call her fair  It is a most uncommon complexion  with her dark eye  lashes and hair  a most distinguishing complexion  So peculiarly the lady in it  Just colour enough for beauty   I have always admired her complexion  replied Emma  archly   but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale  When we first began to talk of her  Have you quite forgotten   Oh  no  what an impudent dog I was  How could I dare  But he laughed so heartily at the recollection  that Emma could not help saying   I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time  you had very great amusement in tricking us all  I am sure you had  I am sure it was a consolation to you   Oh  no  no  no  how can you suspect me of such a thing  I was the most miserable wretch   Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth  I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you  to feel that you were taking us all in  Perhaps I am the readier to suspect  because  to tell you the truth  I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation  I think there is a little likeness between us  He bowed   If not in our dispositions  she presently added  with a look of true sensibility   there is a likeness in our destiny  the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own   True  true  he answered  warmly   No  not true on your side  You can have no superior  but most true on mine  She is a complete angel  Look at her  Is not she an angel in every gesture  Observe the turn of her throat  Observe her eyes  as she is looking up at my father  You will be glad to hear  inclining his head  and whispering seriously  that my uncle means to give her all my aunt  s jewels  They are to be new set  I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head  Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair   Very beautiful  indeed  replied Emma  and she spoke so kindly  that he gratefully burst out   How delighted I am to see you again  and to see you in such excellent looks  I would not have missed this meeting for the world  I should certainly have called at Hartfield  had you failed to come  The others had been talking of the child  Mrs  Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under  the evening before  from the infant  s appearing not quite well  She believed she had been foolish  but it had alarmed her  and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr  Perry  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed  but Mr  Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself  In ten minutes  however  the child had been perfectly well again  This was her history  and particularly interesting it was to Mr  Woodhouse  who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry  and only regretted that she had not done it   She should always send for Perry  if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered  were it only for a moment  She could not be too soon alarmed  nor send for Perry too often  It was a pity  perhaps  that he had not come last night  for  though the child seemed well now  very well considering  it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it  Frank Churchill caught the name   Perry  said he to Emma  and trying  as he spoke  to catch Miss Fairfax  s eye   My friend Mr  Perry  What are they saying about Mr  Perry  Has he been here this morning  And how does he travel now  Has he set up his carriage  Emma soon recollected  and understood him  and while she joined in the laugh  it was evident from Jane  s countenance that she too was really hearing him  though trying to seem deaf   Such an extraordinary dream of mine  he cried   I can never think of it without laughing  She hears us  she hears us  Miss Woodhouse  I see it in her cheek  her smile  her vain attempt to frown  Look at her  Do not you see that  at this instant  the very passage of her own letter  which sent me the report  is passing under her eye  that the whole blunder is spread before her  that she can attend to nothing else  though pretending to listen to the others  Jane was forced to smile completely  for a moment  and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him  and said in a conscious  low  yet steady voice   How you can bear such recollections  is astonishing to me  They _will_ sometimes obtrude  but how you can court them  He had a great deal to say in return  and very entertainingly  but Emma  s feelings were chiefly with Jane  in the argument  and on leaving Randalls  and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men  she felt  that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill  and really regarding him as she did with friendship  she had never been more sensible of Mr  Knightley  s high superiority of character  The happiness of this most happy day  received its completion  in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced  CHAPTER XIX If Emma had still  at intervals  an anxious feeling for Harriet  a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr  Knightley  and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination  it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty  A very few days brought the party from London  and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet  than she became perfectly satisfied  unaccountable as it was  that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr  Knightley  and was now forming all her views of happiness  Harriet was a little distressed  did look a little foolish at first  but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly  and self  deceived  before  her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words  and leave her without a care for the past  and with the fullest exultation in the present and future  for  as to her friend  s approbation  Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature  by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations  Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley  s  and the dinner the next day  she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight  But what did such particulars explain  The fact was  as Emma could now acknowledge  that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin  and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible  Beyond this  it must ever be unintelligible to Emma  The event  however  was most joyful  and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so  Harriet  s parentage became known  She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman  rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers  and decent enough to have always wished for concealment  Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for  It was likely to be as untainted  perhaps  as the blood of many a gentleman  but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr  Knightley  or for the Churchills  or even for Mr  Elton  The stain of illegitimacy  unbleached by nobility or wealth  would have been a stain indeed  No objection was raised on the father  s side  the young man was treated liberally  it was all as it should be  and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin  who was now introduced at Hartfield  she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend  She had no doubt of Harriet  s happiness with any good  tempered man  but with him  and in the home he offered  there would be the hope of more  of security  stability  and improvement  She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her  and who had better sense than herself  retired enough for safety  and occupied enough for cheerfulness  She would be never led into temptation  nor left for it to find her out  She would be respectable and happy  and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world  to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man  or  if not quite the luckiest  to yield only to herself  Harriet  necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins  was less and less at Hartfield  which was not to be regretted  The intimacy between her and Emma must sink  their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill  and  fortunately  what ought to be  and must be  seemed already beginning  and in the most gradual  natural manner  Before the end of September  Emma attended Harriet to church  and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction  as no remembrances  even connected with Mr  Elton as he stood before them  could impair  Perhaps  indeed  at that time she scarcely saw Mr  Elton  but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself  Robert Martin and Harriet Smith  the latest couple engaged of the three  were the first to be married  Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury  and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells  The Mr  Churchills were also in town  and they were only waiting for November  The intermediate month was the one fixed on  as far as they dared  by Emma and Mr  Knightley  They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield  to allow them the fortnight  s absence in a tour to the seaside  which was the plan  John and Isabella  and every other friend  were agreed in approving it  But Mr  Woodhouse  how was Mr  Woodhouse to be induced to consent  he  who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event  When first sounded on the subject  he was so miserable  that they were almost hopeless  A second allusion  indeed  gave less pain  He began to think it was to be  and that he could not prevent it  a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation  Still  however  he was not happy  Nay  he appeared so much otherwise  that his daughter  s courage failed  She could not bear to see him suffering  to know him fancying himself neglected  and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr  Knightleys  that when once the event were over  his distress would be soon over too  she hesitated  she could not proceed  In this state of suspense they were befriended  not by any sudden illumination of Mr  Woodhouse  s mind  or any wonderful change of his nervous system  but by the operation of the same system in another way  Mrs  Weston  s poultry  house was robbed one night of all her turkeys  evidently by the ingenuity of man  Other poultry  yards in the neighbourhood also suffered  Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr  Woodhouse  s fears  He was very uneasy  and but for the sense of his son  in  law  s protection  would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life  The strength  resolution  and presence of mind of the Mr  Knightleys  commanded his fullest dependence  While either of them protected him and his  Hartfield was safe  But Mr  John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November  The result of this distress was  that  with a much more voluntary  cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment  she was able to fix her wedding  day  and Mr  Elton was called on  within a month from the marriage of Mr  and Mrs  Robert Martin  to join the hands of Mr  Knightley and Miss Woodhouse  The wedding was very much like other weddings  where the parties have no taste for finery or parade  and Mrs  Elton  from the particulars detailed by her husband  thought it all extremely shabby  and very inferior to her own  Very little white satin  very few lace veils  a most pitiful business  Selina would stare when she heard of it  But  in spite of these deficiencies  the wishes  the hopes  the confidence  the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony  were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union  FINIS\n"
